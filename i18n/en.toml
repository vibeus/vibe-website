[i18n-content-comparison-samsung-flip-difference-body]

The Samsung Flip 2 is a practical and reliable way to engage same-location teams in creative collaborations,
but isn't designed for remote or distributed teams. Vibe gives your business more ways to grow, share,
and work together for just a little bigger investment, and we think that’s worth it.

## Samsung Flip 2 Pricing
The Flip 2’s 55” model costs $2,199 and is sold separately from the mobile stand ($799).

## Samsung Flip 2 Highlights
The most distinct feature of the Flip 2—in fact, the feature that gives the board its name— is its ability to
flip from a horizontal to vertical position, just as you would be able to do with a standard paper flipchart.
(Though it’s important to note that this is only possible with the 55” model.)

Also similar to a paper flipchart is the Flip 2’s natural drawing and annotating abilities. Up to four people
can draw on the board simultaneously, which is ideal for a team brainstorming session. The board was also
designed with efficiency in mind, so the editing tools are quick and easy to use.

Users can wirelessly connect to the board and changes will be reflected across all connected devices. With the
Flip 2, team members can share Microsoft Office files, brainstorming sessions, drawings and more via email,
screenshare, thumb drive, or printed sheets.

## What’s Missing
The Flip 2 is a good business tool, but the limited access to third-party apps keeps it from being the best
option for collaboration. Users can view PDFs and open files from Microsoft Office, but  the ability to
integrate a large variety of apps doesn’t exist.

Because video conferencing apps like GoToMeeting and Zoom are inaccessible on the Flip 2 (and the board doesn’t
have a built-in camera), your team’s meeting, training, or brainstorming session is limited to whoever is in the
same room. Any business with remote workers would need to find another solution for keeping the team on the same
page.

On the subject of pages, it’s important to note that work sessions on the Flip 2 are limited to 20 pages. This
could be plenty of space for some users and smaller projects; however, knowing that other digital whiteboards
have an infinite canvas makes the 20-page limit seem restrictive."""

The Vibe whiteboarding experience includes an infinite canvas with an AI text converter for handwriting,
highlighter for document annotation, lasso tool for edits, sticky notes, and much more. These writing and
drawing options let you design, edit, and continue to refine your work and Vibe offers 10 simultaneous
touchpoints, vs the Flip 2 can only accommodate 4.

And because it’s likely that remote team members are working on a variety of tech products, Vibe supports
screencasting from computers and mobile devices to the Vibe board regardless of the device’s manufacturer.

other = "Surface Hub Overview"

[i18n-content-comparison-microsoft-surface-hub-difference-body]
other = """## Key Takeaway
Finding the right product comes down to balancing features and capabilities with budget. Priced at $2,999
(vs. the $8,999 price tag of the Surface Hub) Vibe offers a cost effective solution for small- to mid- sized
marketing and design agencies, startups, and tech firms.

The Surface Hub is a good choice if you only need to use Microsoft applications and are interested in a device
that has a battery pack option.

## Microsoft Surface Hub 2S Pricing
The Surface Hub S2 is just under $9,000 for the 50” model. The wall mount costs $249, the mobile stand costs
$1,450, and the battery expansion will run you an additional $1,400.

## Microsoft Surface Hub 2S Highlights
Like most digital whiteboards, the Surface Hub 2S features built-in technology for video conferences and
whiteboarding sessions. The responsive touchscreen is designed to feel as natural as drawing on a traditional
whiteboard.

The Surface Hub 2S’s 4K digital display enables real-time creation so you can work alongside your colleagues
on projects. Screen sharing allows your team to access the canvas and share Office 365 files.

While the original Surface Hub was optimized for meetings, the new edition goes a step further in upping its
video conferencing game by including a modular 4K camera. Users can select from a few different plug-in
locations to find their ideal camera angle.

Another notable feature of the S2 is the battery expansion. The battery holds a two-hour charge 
and takes 90 minutes to fully charge. This, combined with the board’s slimmed down design (weighing 40 percent
less than the previous model), gives users the option to make meetings mobile.

## What’s Missing
Like its predecessor, the Surface Hub S2 is heavily reliant on the Universal Windows 10 application system,
which creates an issue for companies who don’t run primarily on Microsoft software.

For instance, connecting to a video conference via Skype requires an Exchange Server or an Office 365 for
Business account along with Skype for Business. In this situation, calling non-Skype users isn’t easy, and
is just one example to consider when hiring freelancers, contract workers, or creating future remote work
opportunities.

The S2 runs on the software of the previous Surface Hub, so the sleeker hardware is the most notable change
with the update. Microsoft’s goal is for companies to be able to switch out the central processing unit with
future updates, but without knowing how long it’ll be before that’s possible, purchasing the S2 is a big
investment.

Another major (and expensive) drawback: all of the useful accessories cost extra. So on top of paying around
$9,000 for the board, the wall mount costs $249, the mobile stand costs $1,450, and the battery expansion
will run you an additional $1,400."""

other = """## Key Takeaway
The Cisco Webex Board offers comprehensive video conferencing capabilities at a correspondingly high price point.
This board is locked into the Cisco Webex ecosystem and does not integrate with other video conferencing software.

## Cisco Webex Pricing
The 55” model starts at $4,990, with an additional $199 per month for cloud service. Stands range from $1,590
(wall) to $3,290 (floor) and mounts are $449.

## Cisco Webex Highlights
With the Webex Board, users can wirelessly connect to other Cisco devices using the Webex Teams app. Team members
can join a meeting by screen sharing the whiteboard, which allows remote workers to annotate on the same canvas as
their colleagues in a different location. Anyone using a device registered in the Cisco Webex cloud can save their
work and access it later for convenience and efficiency.

The board’s 4K camera responds to movement in the room, making it easy to open a video conference. The multi-point
microphone system responds to voice commands and is able to focus on and amplify the speaker’s voice in a team
meeting with up to 10 people in one room.

The board’s advanced video conferencing features and easy-to-use collaborative tools make the Cisco Webex a good
choice for educational purposes. Universities use the Webex to facilitate both in-classroom and online learning.

## What’s Missing
Offices that don’t run predominantly on Webex Teams will find this subscription requirement to be a challenge.
Connecting non-Webex users—for example, anyone using Zoom, GoToMeeting, or other popular online video conferencing
tools—would be a problem. This would primarily be a concern for businesses with a large contingency of remote or
freelance workers.

To get the most out of your Cisco Webex board, your office must purchase monthly or yearly Webex subscriptions.
Without this, the board can only be used for in-room presentations. It’s also worth noting that although a floor
stand is available for the board, the stand itself isn’t mobile, largely confining the board to one location.

Another less obvious drawback is the amount of Webex hardware and software combinations that exist. Sorting
through the various pieces of tech, subscription plans, and software programs is a confusing process, and it’s
hard to know if you’re paying for equipment and programs you’ll actually use or if you’ll be overpaying for
underutilized items."""

tools—whichever works best for the team.

The Vibe board also features a portable, wheeled stand so you can easily move the meeting location and keep
your equipment with you. And once you leave the meeting room, it’s easy to switch to your mobile device and
pick up where you left off by using the Vibe app.

## SMART Board Pricing

SMART boards are available in a range of sizes with varying functionalities. Depending on whether you’re using
the board in a business or education setting, users can select from the MX, 6000, or 7000 series for boards with
interactive touchscreen displays.

Multiple people can work together directly on the board. SMART Technology’s 6000 series board responds to up to
eight touchpoints and can detect whether the user is drawing with a stylus or erasing by hand. You can connect up
to eight devices simultaneously for screen sharing. SMART Technology puts a lot of emphasis on the board as an
educational tool, which makes the free one-year subscription to the SMART Learning Suite software with the
purchase of a board a nice bonus for educators.

Business users can make the most of their board’s capabilities with features like Meeting Pro and TeamWorks,
which provide access to a limited number of apps, such as Microsoft 365 and most video conferencing apps.

## What’s Missing
The SMART Board has many interesting and useful capabilities; however, nearly all of the best features that set
the SMART Board apart from other digital whiteboards require several subscriptions or licenses.

For businesses, the SMART TeamWorks software enables groups to meet and collaborate, but there are different
levels of access.

- The Rooms edition allows you to work with people in the same room, and you can screen share with up to eight
  devices, but those devices can’t contribute to a shared workspace.
- The next level up, Connected, lets other devices contribute to the workspace but they all have to be on the
  same network.
- Users have to add a Server subscription to the Connected edition before they can allow remote workers to
  join in.

As previously mentioned, classrooms receive a one-year subscription to the SMART Learning Suite service with
purchase of a board but will have to pay for Learning Suite access after that year. The basic plan still has
nice features, but without the Learning Suite the board’s functionality (primarily the collaboration tools)
feels incomplete.

Another missed opportunity for the SMART Board is the ability to save your work to the cloud. Users need to
email or save a PDF of their whiteboard content if they plan on sharing it."""

other = """The Vibe board is designed to easily work with popular educational apps like Blackboard, Canvas,
and Panapto to encourage creative learning. But users aren’t limited to just a handful of app integrations.
Vibe gives you access to over 50 third-party apps so you can use whichever programs meet your needs.

There are no subscriptions, licenses, or confusing mix-and-match software requirements to get what you want.
You can access the Vibe app from any device to go back to your boards, and can collaborate in real time from
other locations from a computer browser or tablet.

Vibe users can also seamlessly collaborate in real time through the Vibe board, Mac, PC, or tablets
(the mobile app is view-only). Once you leave the physical meeting room, it’s easy to switch to your handy devices
and pick up where you left off. Vibe also supports screencasting from computers and mobile devices to the board,
regardless of the device’s manufacturer.

Another big selling point? The price. At $2,999, Vibe is less than half the price of the SMART Board 6000 series.

other = """The Jamboard is a 55” cloud-based digital whiteboard designed for businesses and education programs.
Launched by Google in 2017, the Jamboard was designed as a direct competitor to the Microsoft Surface Hub."""

other = "Google Jamboard Overview"

[i18n-content-comparison-google-jamboard-difference-body]
other = """## Key Takeaway
Google Jamboard is a great fit if your business runs primarily on G Suite. But if you need the flexibility
to use applications outside of the Google ecosystem (at almost half the price) it’s time to check out Vibe.

## Jamboard Pricing
Google Jamboard starts at $4,999 and comes standard with a wall mount, with additional charges after purchase.
Jamboard users pay an annual $600 subscription and support fee, as well as $12/month for access to a GSuite
Business account. The Jamboard’s mobile stand is $1,349 and is sold separately.

## Jamboard Highlights
The Jamboard has 4K display and a built-in camera and microphone, making it easy to run a Google Hangout video
conference with your team or customers from the device. 

Each board comes with 2 styluses, which you can use to draw during whiteboarding sessions. You can also draw
on the touchscreen with your finger, as well as erase with your hand or use the board’s physical eraser.

For users who aren’t directly interacting with the Jamboard, whiteboard content can be accessed using Android
and iOS apps on a range of personal mobile devices. (Depending on how you join the session, though, your ability
to contribute to the session may be limited.)

Anyone who starts a session on the Jamboard can invite other users to join as long as those users have a Gmail
account or are registered with your business’s G Suite account. Team members participating through the smartphone
app can add files to the session through Google Drive and a selection of Google Images, but they can’t directly
annotate on the canvas.

When your session is done or needs to move to a new location, it is saved to the cloud so you can share with
other users and refer back to the saved session.

## What’s Missing
While using the Jamboard is fairly intuitive, it doesn’t allow all users to access the whiteboarding sessions
equally. People who access the session through a tablet-based app can contribute to the session by adding files
and notes from their Drive, but users who don't have the Jamboard app can only participate in view-only mode.

Many projects require using more than one app, and the Jamboard doesn’t support simultaneous app usage.
This severely limits versatility for brainstorming sessions with multiple people using the board at the same time.

Users can get a lot accomplished with G Suite, but it doesn’t include some of today’s most popular business,
video conferencing, and workflow apps. Jamboard’s limited suite of integrations could mean that your office will
have to adjust the way projects are completed, which could cost you valuable time."""

other = "How It Compares to Vibe"

[i18n-content-comparison-google-jamboard-why-body]
other = """Vibe also has a 55” touchscreen with 4K resolution. Vibe boards come with digital whiteboard software built
in, and features an infinite canvas so your ideas and brainstorming sessions are never limited.
With robust writing and drawing options, Vibe comes out with new software features every 2-3 weeks. 

Some of the tools you can use through the intuitive touchscreen include:

- Import images and documents from Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive
- Background colors and grid options
- AI text convertor (converts handwriting into text)
- highlighter for document annotation
- laser pointer for presentations
- 2 split screen options so you can whiteboard next to 40+ 3rd party applications
- Colorful sticky notes
- Software apps for computers and tablets to help your team stay connected in real time
- and more!

All Vibe users can edit the canvas in real time through the Vibe board, Mac, PC, or tablet devices when you
share a link to that board. So whether you’re in the office or working remotely, you can collaborate seamlessly
with your team.

Vibe users also have access to over 50 third-party app integrations. This includes Google Drive as well as the
Microsoft Office Suite, Slack, Asana, Zoom, and many more. Your team can use the tools you’ve already invested
time and money in without having to learn a new system.

Wirelessly screencast from any device using Airplay, Chromecast, or eShare, or use an HDMI cable. Annotate on
anything - while screencasting or using 3rd party apps, you can easily annotate and save screenshots to your
board. 

Work on your project without interruption, because Vibe lets you run multiple apps at the same time. For example,
if you want to give a presentation to your teams or clients, you can easily access the PowerPoint from OneDrive
on your Vibe board or screencast it from your laptop.

Compatible with most USB webcams, Vibe can be used in tandem with 3rd party video conference apps so you can
share the whiteboard screen with remote participants and get the most from your meetings and brainstorming
sessions. 

At $2,999, Vibe is almost half the price of the Google Jamboard, but with more functionality and collaboration
with other applications. Vibe is compatible with standard wall mounts and also offers an optional mobile stand
for only $500. Best of all, Vibe’s software is included in your hardware purchase.  Vibe has detailed Help Center
resources and offers ongoing customer support by phone and email at no extra charge.
