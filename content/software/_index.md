        The Vibe team has been incredibly open to new ideas to improve the product and even implemented a few
        suggestions into the most recent software update. This type of co-collaboration makes working with Vibe
        a premier experience. Absolutely would recommend it to anyone in the market for a digital white-board!

        The Vibe board has been a game changer in how we communicate with clients, both in-person and virtually.
        I am a long-time user of electronic whiteboards, but the interactive and digital features of the Vibe board
        have exponentially increased both efficiency and the "wow" factor in client meetings.

        With Vibe, I can now just hit “send” after a meeting and share that board with whoever I want.
        Vibe will save each board automatically, so I can always pull a board back up during any meeting to show
        people what we’ve discussed. Even better, we like how you can invite remote coworkers in to collaborate
        on the board in real time from other devices. Vibe is a gamechanger.

        Vibe’s collaboration factor has been huge. When juggling multiple clients, it’s incredibly helpful to have
        everything saved in one place so you can easily pick up where you left off.
        As a UX designer, I like how easy Vibe is to pick up a stylus and sketch on. And for big projects we can
        even have several people working on a single canvas at once - even from remote locations.
