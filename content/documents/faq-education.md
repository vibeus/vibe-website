      question: How can my remote students see their teachers drawing on a whiteboard?
      answer: |
        There are a few options to share Vibe remotely:

        - From the Vibe board, join or host your video conference application (ex: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet) and
        then share your screen so students can see any content shared on the Vibe board.
          - Check [this online teaching video from Vibe customer, Professor Henry Silverman][1].
        - Share a link (edit or view only) of the whiteboard with your students so they can interact with you on the canvas
          in real time or view content in real time (note: with this option, they will not be able to see any content shared
          from screencast or 3rd party apps - only what is in the Vibe board app)
        - You can also export the Vibe board as a PDF after a lesson and share the file with students after the class.

    - id: interact
      question: Can students interact with the whiteboard in real-time? Even without a Vibe board?
      answer: |
        Yes. Vibe is a cloud-based software that is accessible on any web browser or tablet, and Vibe also has an app for
        iPad (the mobile app is view-only).

        If you want to [share a board][2], simply share the link of the Vibe board you are using as a link (or copy into the
        chat during your video conference) so they can interact with you on the canvas in real time.

        Note: [Vibe can also be added as an application with Microsoft Teams][3].
