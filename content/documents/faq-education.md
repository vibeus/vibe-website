      question: How can remote students see their teachers drawing on a Vibe whiteboard?
      answer: |
        There are a few ways to share your view of the Vibe board remotely:

        - From the Vibe board, join or host your video conference application (such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams,
          or Google Meet), then share your screen. Students can now see any content you share on the Vibe board.
          - To see this in action, check out [this online teaching video][1] from Vibe customer [Dr. Henry Silverman][2].
        - Share a link (edit or view only) of the whiteboard with your students so they can interact with you on the
          canvas in real time or view content in real time.
          - **Note**: with this option, students will only be able to view content specifically in the Vibe board app.
            Content shared from screencast or 3rd party apps will not be visible.
        - If connecting in real time isn’t an option, teachers can export the Vibe board as a PDF and share the file
          with students after the class.
