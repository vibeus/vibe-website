# Cancel the order

We accept order cancellation before the product is shipped. If you cancel the order, you will get a full refund. If the product has already been shipped, you will not be able to cancel the order.

# Returns

If you purchased a Vibe board or Vibe mobile stand directly from Vibe, you can request a return within the first 30 days after you have received delivery of your product. (For Amazon purchases, please contact us through Amazon). However, you need to pay the return delivery fee.

**If 30 days have gone by since you received your purchase, unfortunately we cannot offer you a refund or exchange**.

Please keep all original packaging in case you need to do a return. Product must not be damaged, and must be shipped back to the nearest return location for your country with all the included accessories and original packaging in order to be eligible for a full refund. (US return location is in Bellevue, WA).

Vibe will need to inspect the product before we can issue a refund.

We also accept return items if they are defective or damaged on arrival.

To request a return or exchange, please fill out the [Return Merchandise Authorization form](https://landing.vibe.us/rma).

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted:

- Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error.

Vibe will replace your damaged item with a brand new replacement and will cover the shipping both ways.

All shipping damages or missing items must be reported within 7 business days upon the receipt of the product. Vibe is not responsible for shipping damages reported after such period.

# Shipping

Upon review of the RMA request, Vibe will provide a shipping label for you to return the product. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping and handling costs for returning your item. These costs are non-refundable.

If you receive a refund, the shipping and handling costs will be deducted from your refund. In the US, the shipping fee is 200 USD/unit and 400 USD/set. For international customers this rate will depend on the shipping cost for your region.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.
