# Returns

Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since you received your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you
a refund or exchange.

Please keep all original packaging in case you need to do a return within the first 30 days of your purchase.
Product must not be damaged, and must be shipped back to Vibe's headquarters with all the included accessories and
original packaging in order to be eligible for a full refund.
Vibe will need to inspect the product before we can issue a refund.

We also accept return items if they are defective or damaged on arrival.

To start return process, please send email to support@vibe.us.

Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted:

- Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error.
- Any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery.

# Refunds

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your
returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit
card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

# Late or missing refunds

If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.

Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.

Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.

If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at support@vibe.us.

# Sale items

Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.

# Exchanges

We replace items if they are defective or damaged on arrival. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us
an email at support@vibe.us and send your item to the address below in the "Shipping" section.

# Gifts

If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the
value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.

If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give
to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.

# Shipping

To return your product, you should mail your product to:

> Vibe Inc.

You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are
non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.

If you are shipping an item over \$1000, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping
insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
