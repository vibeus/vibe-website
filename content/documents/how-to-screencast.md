Screencasting is simple with Vibe Interactive Digital Whiteboard, both wirelessly and via HDMI cable, regardless of the operating system youâ€™re using. Vibe has its own screencast options, as well as easy integration with Airplay or Eshare; a multi-screen interaction software.

For Windows and Android devices, you can screencast using the EShare app.

For Mac/iOS devices, you can screencast using AirPlay or the EShare app.

For Chrome or Firefox browsers, Vibe has our very own screen-casting software.
