Remote whiteboards are getting hastily snapped up by educators across the country, as schools face a school year teaching children from home. The school smart board prices are at the forefront of everyone’s minds as school budgets account for this new expense, and some teachers are reaching into their own pockets to cover the expense. It’s no wonder that these handy devices are catching the eye of those who are looking to simplify the distance learning experience, and find ways to keep their students engaged.
