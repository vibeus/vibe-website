Vibe’s simple remote whiteboard couldn’t be any easier to use - virtually ready to go out of the box, it was designed to be intuitive for just about any user.

Once you power on your digital board, you’ll be walked through a few easy set-up steps, such as connecting your WiFi network and naming your board. From there, you can immediately start using the canvas as a guest, or you can log in or register your Vibe software account.

Vibe’s easy to use digital whiteboard utilizes a touchscreen, and integrates many of the apps you already use, such as Zoom, Slack, DropBox, Microsoft Office Suite, YouTube, and Netflix.

Installation is simple with our mobile stand to have the option to use the board in any room.

Let us show you just how simple it is to use the Vibe interactive whiteboard.
