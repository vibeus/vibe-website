Sharing your Vibe custom collaborative board through Zoom is as simple as a few taps of the screen. Vibe interactive whiteboard allows you to share and collaborate with anyone, from anywhere, in real-time.

To do a collaborative whiteboard in Zoom, youâ€™ll simply open Zoom from your suite of apps in Vibe, and simply follow the normal prompts to either join a meeting, or host a meeting. From there, you share a link to the Vibe board app from anywhere in the world allowing them to comment, share files, make notes, conceptualize, and design. When the meeting is over, export your board and send to participants, or simply save for later review.
