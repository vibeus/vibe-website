        I ordered one, then saw that it was so useful we proceeded to toss out all our whiteboards and replace
        them with Vibe’s.  It’s the best collaboration device we have at our office for memorializing any and all
        types of meetings – from administrative tasks to software design sessions.
        Incredible device, saves us time and money and allows us to build our AI software products faster!
        Congratulations on a game changer!

          few suggestions into the most recent software update. This type of co-collaboration makes working

          We selected Vibe for use in our public training center with individuals, small companies and
          corporate clients. Our selection criteria were based on four requirements: 

          **Range of capabilities**
          We “draw” training notes and exercises, save/email docs and collaborate between local and remote
          participants – all through Vibe

          **Product support/training**
          Vibe team provides premier client support and training

          **Simple/intuitive operation**
          We received, unwrapped, assembled and began using Vibe in less than 40 minutes...absolutely intuitive!

          **Low total operating costs/cost of ownership**
          Vibe provides greatest range of capabilities, highest value and NO ongoing licensing and annual costs.

          Vibe is “Best of Breed” in the real-time digital whiteboard market space!

        Vibe’s collaboration factor has been huge. Vibe helps our team integrate research, notes and screen shots
        for a project into a single canvas - we no longer have interrupt the creative process to check notes in
        other locations. When juggling multiple clients, it’s incredibly helpful to have everything saved in one
        place so you can easily pick up where you left off. As a UX designer, I like how easy Vibe is to pick up
        a stylus and sketch on. And for big projects we can even have several people working on a single canvas
        at once - even from remote locations.

    testimonial:

        I’ve always been a big whiteboard user - even my staff like to joke about this - but it can be a pain to
        share out a detailed plan you just worked on...  you have to take a picture or assign someone to write
        something up. With Vibe, I can now just hit “send” after a meeting and share that board with whoever I want.
        Vibe will save each board automatically, so I can always pull a board back up during any meeting to show
        people what we’ve discussed. Even better, we like how you can invite remote coworkers in to collaborate on
        the board in real time from other devices. Vibe is a gamechanger.

        The Vibe board has been a game changer in how we communicate with clients, both in-person and virtually.
        I am a long-time user of electronic whiteboards, but the interactive and digital features of the Vibe board
        have exponentially increased both efficiency and the "wow" factor in client meetings.
