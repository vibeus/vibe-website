Today we all spend a considerable portion of every day looking at our screens. That’s why **choosing the right office monitor** is more important than ever. Luckily, you can get quite the bang for your buck these days. **Plenty of current low-end panels perform even better than high-end models.** No matter what kind of monitor you’re looking for, there are certain factors to consider. This article will discuss some critical elements of [office monitors](https://www.displayninja.com/best-monitor-for-office-work/) and list some of our top picks for this year.

## Office monitor price ranges

The [price of the monitor](https://uk.pcmag.com/monitors/9527/the-best-computer-monitors) will depend on the screen size, target audience, and display features. **For under $100, you can find a basic 22-inch or 23-inch model.** However, you probably won’t get a variety of features, such as a height-adjustable stand or a wide variety of ports. Fortunately, the performance will meet most essential business and productivity needs, though there may be issues with color and grayscale accuracy for more detailed tasks.

High-end models are often marketed for photographers and graphic design professionals. The majority of these are 27-inch to 38-inch panels and support 4K resolution (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) and can display four times the resolution of your average full HD monitor. They also offer features like a range of ports, a highly adjustable stand, and a wide range of advanced image settings.

A high-performance, fully loaded 4K or Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) monitor will cost you $1,000 and up. Premium professional monitors can cost between $2,000 and $6,000.

## Which major features should I look for in a monitor?

If you’re [sharing a monitor](https://vibe.us/blog/the-technical-tools-that-have-made-education-possible-during-the-pandemic/) with family members or a co-worker, a model with an ergonomic stand allows individuals to position the screen for their ideal viewing angle. A **fully adjustable stand** provides height, tilt, and swivel adjustments. Plus, you can rotate the panel for portrait-mode viewing (pivot adjustment).

Look for an office monitor with **built-in USB ports** if you often attach and detach USB devices. Ideally, at least two of these ports will be mounted on the wide of the cabinet, which makes it easy to plug thumb drives and other USB peripherals in.

Other features to look for include speaker quality and a glossy screen vs. a matte screen.

## What size monitor do I need?

Having a big viewing area feels great but isn’t always practical depending on your desktop-space constraints. **The bigger the screen, the higher the price.**

If you want to watch movies or browse multi-page documents but have tight desk space and budget constraints, a **24-inch monitor** is a solid choice. Have a little more room to work with? Then a 27-inch or larger will deliver a big-screen experience. And if space isn’t a problem, bring a movie-theater experience to your desktop with a massive, curved-screen model.
