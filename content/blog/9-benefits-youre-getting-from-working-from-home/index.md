You've probably been spending a lot of time indoors these days. Even though certain states and attractions are opening up, many locations are still seeing huge spikes in coronavirus cases. If your office is still letting you stay home, you should take them up on the offer. It's really the best option for your health — but, it also has a lot of hidden perks.
 
Here are some benefits you're getting from working at home that you might not have thought of before.
 

## You're getting more time with your family. 

It might not be productive time, but it's definitely time. For new parents with a baby at home, they're more likely to catch milestone moments, like a first step or first word. Babies grow up incredibly fast, and it's wonderful to see them progress. By working at home, you're present — and able to witness these special moments in person.

## Pets are allowed in your home office. 

Do you love dogs? Most people do. Being able to work with your dog by your side is actually an excellent, safe way to lower your stress levels. [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/therapy-dog-offers-stress-relief-at-work-201107223111) writes that dogs in the workplace can be a wonderful way to help manage your moods. "Pets have been shown to lower blood pressure, improve recovery from heart disease, and even reduce rates of asthma and allergy in children who grow up with a Fido or a Frisky in the house," they write. "Pets also improve people’s psychological well-being and self-esteem."


## You can get more housework done. 

It's easy to throw in a load of laundry while waiting for an email response. You might even become better at multitasking due to having a little more control over your day. It might seem like a small perk, but it'll allow you to manage your free time a little better.
 

## You can eat healthier.

How many times did you forget your packed lunch at home? Or, just felt uninspired to eat it? It's tempting to call in for delivery while working at an office, especially if you have coworkers enabling you. But when you work from home, you have access to your full kitchen and a way to create healthy hot meals that are a little more exciting than peanut butter and jelly.
 

## You're not just avoiding the coronavirus. 

Have you noticed you've been a lot less sick while staying at home? Personally, everyone in my home has avoided the colds and allergies they'd normally get around this time. It's nice to feel genuinely healthy. The healthier we are, the happier and more productive we become. It's also nice not having to have the internal "am I too sick to go to work today?" debate. Even if you're feeling a little under the weather, you can still chat up your coworkers from the comforts of your own bed.

## There's no commute. 

How many times have you been worried about getting stuck in traffic? Less time (and stress) behind the wheel also means that there's a much lower chance for getting into an accident. So it's yet another way you're staying safe. As a bonus, you're also saving on gas money. If you had a long daily commute prior to the Stay At Home orders, you're probably saving a ton of money effortlessly.
 

## You're giving the environment a break. 

There is only one Earth. It's great to have a goal to do your part, but big changes make more of an impact. Now, with people at home, there's already been a major difference in our environment. "Air that's usually cloudy with smog has cleared," writes [EcoWatch](https://www.ecowatch.com/pandemic-work-from-home-2646075912.html?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5). "Los Angeles, which has notoriously pollution-choked skies, could recently boast having the cleanest air in the world. And this year, experts predict, the transportation transformation will contribute to the largest-ever annual decline in global carbon emissions." When the Earth is healthier, you're healthier — and you can feel good about what's to come for the future of our planet.
 

## You're getting to know your neighborhood better — sort of.

So, you might not be having full-on chats with your neighbors — especially if masks aren't involved. But you can still learn a lot about the ins-and-outs of your neighborhood while working from home. You can figure out when, exactly, the trash gets picked up. You can look out the window and see people passing by. You can take long walks and enjoy the beautiful flower displays your neighbors have put out. You'll feel more in tune with your community.
 

## You'll feel less judged. 

Obviously, when you're at work, your main focus should be work. But it's easy to send a quick text to a friend when you know your boss isn't looking over your shoulder. Working from home makes you feel a little less judged. All eyes aren't on you unless you're presenting at a Zoom meeting. Dress codes are also out the window. Feel like wearing a pair of yoga pants to work? You now have the option — and nobody has to know. It may also help your productivity go up if you're working comfortably and remotely.
 
Even if you miss the conversations you'd normally have at the office, working from home can be a really nice break. It's also good to know that you have the option of taking a remote day at home in case your business wants to start moving back to the way things used to be. This period has proven that — with a little leeway for trial and error — most of us are able to stay productive and healthy while working remotely.
