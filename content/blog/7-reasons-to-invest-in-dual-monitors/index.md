Every business wants its employees to be as efficient and productive as possible. So, how do you create a workspace that encourages this? There are many ways to boost performance in the workplace, but switching to dual monitor setups is one affordable and easy way to do it.

[Remote working](https://vibe.us/blog/the-vocabulary-of-remote-work/) is becoming increasingly popular, and that means the way we work is changing. We’ll show you why dual monitor setups are one of the best changes to make for working at home even better.

## What is a dual monitor setup?

Dual monitor setups allow you to use two screens that operate from a single computer. Think of it as [a visual extension of your workspace](https://vibe.us/blog/interactive-whiteboard-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-do/). There are many applications where having a dual monitor setup offers practically unlimited advantages, and almost all computers are capable of handling two monitors.

Here are seven key advantages to using more than one computer monitor.

## A dual monitor setup increases productivity

**Reduce downtime**  
Dual monitor setups are inherently redundant; if something happens to one monitor, employees can continue to work using the working one **without any productivity or data loss**. There is no other monitor setup that can [offer that type of flexibility.](https://vibe.us/blog/9-benefits-youre-getting-from-working-from-home/) Plus, dual monitors are extremely easy to maintain.

**Increase work flow on computer**  
When using two monitors from a single computer, each employee can easily **run multiple applications at once** without having to change windows — this basically doubles the amount of available workspace. Dual monitors also make it simple to drag and drop data from each application to another.

## Dual monitors are great for certain tasks

**Zoom calls**  
Video sharing apps, like Zoom, often allow screen sharing during a video call. This allows your employees to [participate in a video conference](https://vibe.us/blog/video-conferencing-apps-with-whiteboard/) **while simultaneously collaborating on their projects**. Dual monitors also allow you to have one screen up with reference materials during Zoom calls and meetings.

**Comparing critical data**  
One of the biggest advantages of dual monitors is that you can have critical information pulled up on one screen to reference while you work on the second screen. Dual monitor setups allow you to **compare different files and projects easily**. You can also view instructional videos and tutorials while repeating the steps on your second screen to learn more efficiently.

## They are simple to use

Dual monitors are extremely easy to use, especially considering the many advantages that they can provide.

Most computers and laptops inherently support dual monitors and don’t require any additional software to set up. Using two monitors is no different than using a single–**anyone who can already use a computer can** instantly adapt **to having an extra screen**.

Moving a window or application from one monitor to another is as simple as dragging it from one screen to the next. Most applications will typically remember which monitor you use it on so, after the initial setup, the computer will know what programs you want to open on each monitor.

## Dual monitors can benefit your entire team

**Increase collaboration**  
Dual monitors make collaboration between employees easier than ever. You can communicate with team members on one screen while working on a project on the other one. Having a second monitor gives you a lot of additional space to collaborate with the rest of the organization.

**Increase communication**  
Communication becomes easier with dual monitors because you can keep in touch with other employees, customers, and management without interrupting your work. You can use communication tools like Zoom, Skype, or Slack while having your project open on the second screen to reference during team discussions.

## Dual monitor setups work well with laptops

One massive advantage of dual monitors is that they are **compatible with laptops and mobile devices**. Laptops typically have small screens that can be more challenging to work on. But when you easily attach a second monitor, you more than double your workspace. You can even work from your mobile device by using a docking station to cast your phone screen onto a second monitor.

## Dual monitors help you maintain focus

**Reduce distractions**  
You might think that having two screens in front of you would provide more distractions than only having one. However, the opposite is true. With a dual monitor setup, you no longer have to switch between tabs while you are working and can **view everything at once without interrupting your workflow**.

**Organize your desktop**  
Dual monitors essentially **give you double the desktop space**, which reduces the cluttering on your screen. Is your desktop full of pinned apps and documents? You can move some of them to the second screen and free up some of the space that they take up. It’s easier to [stay organized](https://vibe.us/blog/6-great-methods-to-help-you-organize-your-ideas-prior-to-your-meeting/) when you have all of that extra room.

## They’re excellent for gaming

[What about when you’re not working?](https://vibe.us/blog/6-uses-for-digital-whiteboards-outside-of-the-office/) Dual monitors give you **a better, enhanced gaming experience**. You can easily have a video, music, or chat opened on the second screen while gaming. And a second monitor is essential for anyone who plans on live streaming — dual monitors allow you to chat and interact with viewers without interrupting your gameplay.

## How to install a dual monitor setup

**There’s not much that you need to** [install dual monitors](https://www.cedarville.edu/insights/blog/monitor-dual-screen-setup-for-desktop-computers.aspx) **other than a computer and the two monitors** that you want to use. Monitors and computers have multiple ways to connect to each other, and there are a few different types of cables you may need. Your monitors will connect with one (or more) of these:

- HDMI
- VGA
- DVI
- DisplayPort

### Set up dual monitors in 3 easy steps

1. Connect the second monitor to a power source and your computer.
2. In your computer’s display settings, choose “Extend these displays” in the multiple displays window.
