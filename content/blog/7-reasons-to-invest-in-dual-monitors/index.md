## How to install a dual monitor setup

**There’s not much that you need to install dual monitors other than a computer and the two monitors** that you want to use. Monitors and computers have multiple ways to connect to each other, and there are a few different types of cables you may need. Your monitors will connect with one (or more) of these:

- HDMI
- VGA
- DVI
- DisplayPort

### Set up dual monitors in a few easy steps

1. Connect the second monitor to a power source and your computer.
2. In your computer’s display settings, choose “Extend these displays” in the multiple displays window.
3. Choose the monitor order and primary display.

That’s it–you’re ready to use your dual monitor setup!

## How dual monitors affect productivity

Many things can help improve performance, and having a dual monitors is one such way. It offers more screen space and dual pages to be shown. This type of setup is perfect for increasing productivity in learning applications, office work, graphic manipulation, and many other types of work.

### Reduce downtime

Dual monitor setups are inherently redundant; if something happens to one monitor, employees can continue to work using the working one **without any productivity or data loss**. There is no other monitor setup that can offer that type of flexibility. Plus, dual monitors are extremely easy to maintain.

### Increase workflow on computer

When using two monitors from a single computer, each employee can easily **run multiple applications at once** without having to change windows—this basically doubles the amount of available workspace. Dual monitors also make it simple to drag and drop data from one application to another.

### Optimizes work performance

Other than increasing productivity, there are a few other benefits of having dual monitors:

- Helps display more content
- Swap between applications quickly
- Easily navigate multiple windows
- View documents side-by-side

### Helps you maintain focus by reducing distractions

You might think that having two screens in front of you would provide more distractions than only having one. However, the opposite is true. With a dual monitor setup, you no longer have to switch between tabs while you are working and can view everything at once without interrupting your workflow.

## Benefits of dual monitors

There are many benefits to using a dual monitor setup. Despite the apparent increase in productivity, there are other ways that this type of setup can help your computer experience.

### They are simple to use

Dual monitors are extremely easy to use, especially considering the many advantages that they can provide.

Most computers and laptops inherently support dual monitors and don’t require any additional software to set up. Using two monitors is no different than using a single–**anyone who can already use a computer can** instantly adapt **to having an extra screen**.

Moving a window or application from one monitor to another is as simple as dragging it from one screen to the next. Most applications will typically remember which monitor you use it on so, after the initial setup, the computer will know what programs you want to open on each monitor.

### Dual monitor setups work well with laptops

One massive advantage of dual monitors is that they are **compatible with laptops and mobile devices**. Laptops typically have small screens that can be more challenging to work on. But when you easily attach a second monitor, you more than double your workspace. You can even work from your mobile device by using a docking station to cast your phone screen onto a second monitor.

### Organize your desktop

Dual monitors essentially **give you double the desktop space**, which reduces the cluttering on your screen. Is your desktop full of pinned apps and documents? You can move some of them to the second screen and free up some of the space that they take up. It’s easier to [stay orga](https://vibe.us/blog/6-great-methods-to-help-you-organize-your-ideas-prior-to-your-meeting/)[n](https://vibe.us/blog/6-great-methods-to-help-you-organize-your-ideas-prior-to-your-meeting/)[ized](https://vibe.us/blog/6-great-methods-to-help-you-organize-your-ideas-prior-to-your-meeting/) when you have all of that extra room.

## What can I do with dual monitors?

Having a dual monitor setup opens up a whole new world of possibilities. And anything you can do with one monitor, you can still do with a dual setup. However, the real benefit comes from some cool features that having a second monitor allows for. Here are some things you can do with a dual monitor setup.

### Zoom calls

Video sharing apps, like Zoom, often allow screen sharing during a video call. This allows your employees to [participate in a video conference](https://vibe.us/blog/video-conferencing-apps-with-whiteboard/) **while simultaneously collaborating on their projects**. Dual monitors also allow you to have one screen up with reference materials during Zoom calls and meetings.

### Comparing critical data

One of the biggest advantages of dual monitors is that you can have critical information pulled up on one screen to reference while you work on the second screen. Dual monitor setups allow you to **compare different files and projects easily**. You can also view instructional videos and tutorials while repeating the steps on your second screen to learn more efficiently.

### Increase collaboration

Dual monitors make collaboration between employees easier than ever. You can communicate with team members on one screen while working on a project on the other one. Having a second monitor gives you a lot of additional space to collaborate with the rest of the organization.

### Increase communication

Communication becomes easier with dual monitors because you can keep in touch with other employees, customers, and management without interrupting your work. You can use communication tools like Zoom, Skype, or Slack while having your project open on the second screen to reference during team discussions.

### They’re excellent for gaming

[What about when you’re not working?](https://vibe.us/blog/6-uses-for-digital-whiteboards-outside-of-the-office/) Dual monitors give you **a better, enhanced gaming experience**. You can easily have a video, music, or chat opened on the second screen while gaming. And a second monitor is essential for anyone who plans on live streaming — dual monitors allow you to chat and interact with viewers without interrupting your gameplay.

## Things to consider before investing

While having a dual monitor setup is great, there are some things that you should consider when looking to add a second or third monitor to your current system.

### Does having two monitors slow down your computer?

While having two monitors **can cause a slight lag in high-quality video or gaming**, most people won’t notice a difference. This lag is because a single computer has to split the processing of pixels. 

You can minimize this by ensuring that both monitors are set to the same color format and resolutions. **Installing dual monitor software onto your driver can also help alleviate significant lag. Making sure your graphic drivers are up to date**. Often they miss an automatic update.

### Are dual monitors good for studying?

There can be many good reasons to invest in a second monitor, and many people agree that adding the extra screen can be helpful for school work. Even at jobs, it can [help increase productivity by 42%](https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/best-dual-computer-monitor-setup-productivity-hack-1138404/). **Rather than switching between open tabs, having study material on one screen and your current project on your main** can help speed up tasks.
