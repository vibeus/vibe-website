In today’s kindergarten classroom, you’ll find that coloring sessions and story time look a little different than they did even just 20 years ago.

Daily lessons in preschool, pre-K, and kindergarten classes incorporate technology in more new ways every year, going beyond having a single computer in the classroom and instead finding opportunities for every child to grow their technology skills.

Hannah Brown, the lead kindergarten teacher at Primrose School of Thornton in Colorado, has seen how her school’s tech offerings have evolved since she entered the field of early childhood education in 2016.

“We have two computers in each classroom, two students iPads, and over this summer we got Google virtual reality goggles,” she says. To further enhance the learning experience, the school also purchased a [Vibe digital whiteboard](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-education/) to use in the upcoming school year.



## A Tradition of Advancing Education

Brown said that her school’s leadership team began researching interactive whiteboards in the classrooms at the beginning of the last school year. With the arrival of the Vibe board, she has been [familiarizing herself with its features](https://vibe.us/faqs-for-teachers-and-educators/) and thinking of ways to integrate the board into her lessons, saying, “I’m starting to see how we can make it work. They could even have this in the preschool class, with learning shapes and the ‘Find the Difference’ game. The kids love those games.”


## How Hannah’s Class Uses Vibe

So far, the children in Brown’s summer class have used the board’s infinite canvas for practicing letters, playing spelling games, and drawing. Brown says, “It’s incredibly versatile; it’s a really awesome board,” adding, “The kids absolutely love it. They feel like the teacher when they’re up there!”

“Since we can’t go on field trips anywhere this summer because of COVID-19, we watch one movie each week,” Brown says. “One week the kids made cars out of cardboard boxes and we did a ‘drive-in’ movie with the Vibe board as the screen. It was really cute.”

As summer wraps up and the academic year begins, Brown envisions using the Vibe board for teaching handwriting, learning shapes and colors, playing educational games, and using it during reading time. She says the board’s split screen feature could be a fun addition to reading time, explaining, “If we don’t have one of the books we need for ‘Read Aloud’ that day, we can watch [a YouTube video of] somebody reading it, and I could write the children’s responses on the other side.”



## Looking Ahead

The Primrose School of Thornton currently plans on offering on-site classes this fall while following all COVID-19 health and safety protocols. In addition to twice-daily temperature checks and masks for everyone 3 years-old and up, class sizes will still be limited in order to follow social distancing guidelines. Brown says that for the most part, the children have taken all of the necessary changes in stride.

“For example, right now we only have four chairs at each table, when normally we would have six,” she says. “So it’s small things like that, where the kids aren’t always in each other’s way, and we encourage them to spread out. It’s totally different, but they’re going with it.”

And if the summer session has been any indication, having new educational tools--like digital whiteboards for teachers--in the room will also give students something to look forward to, even if class is a little different this year.

“They’re loving the Vibe board,” Brown says. “It’s definitely a great addition to the classroom.”
