As educational technology advances, interactive whiteboards are an increasingly common sight in classrooms. Also referred to as smart boards, this interactive multi-functional technology is intuitive and convenient for educators. It’s no wonder, then, that smart boards are used in about [50-70% of classrooms](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1263248.pdf) in developed countries around the world. It also helps that smart board games are a fun way to **engage elementary students and teach core curriculum** through new activities.

Smart boards are extremely effective at attracting and engaging elementary students. By adding gamification into the learning experience, children are excited to learn and participate.
