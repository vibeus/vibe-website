Stand-up meetings are one of the best and most effective ways to motivate a high-performing team. The concept is pretty simple: it’s a brief team meeting, held every day, to cover key aspects of ongoing projects. And regular stand-up meetings could mean fewer meetings overall—win! So if your goal is to create a culture of success in an agile workplace, read on to learn how this daily check-in could lead to a more cohesive team.


## 1. Saves time with fewer meetings

We knew you liked the sound of fewer meetings, and it’s true: scheduling a focused 15- to 20-minute meeting every day keeps your team current on every person’s progress, as well as anything that’s holding them up. This saves time in the long run because if everyone is up to speed on the other parts of the project, there’s no need for extra meetings.


## 2. Strengthens the team’s concept of common goals

It’s easy to get wrapped up in your own tasks and lose sight of what your co-workers are doing all day, especially if you’re part of a distributed team. With a daily sync, team members are regularly reminded of what they’re working on as a group and can improve their workflows to meet shared goals.


## 3. Reduces roadblocks

No matter your industry, issues arise every once in a while. Bringing any hangups to the team’s attention sooner rather than later means you can develop a solution more quickly. Waiting days or weeks to do this wastes valuable time, so checking in daily means you’ll be more productive overall.

## 4. Promotes transparency and teamwork

Giving each person one or two minutes to list their daily accomplishments and challenges keeps everyone honest for the benefit of the group. Sharing lets people step up and offer help as needed, which strengthens the team’s camaraderie. And if you have remote workers on staff, transparency and teamwork will go a long way in making them feel included.


## 5. Expands the team’s project knowledge

Remember what we said earlier about getting caught up in your own work? You could have the key piece of information needed to move another part of the team’s project forward, so sharing what you know is important. The team’s solutions can only get better with each person’s input and experience.


## 6. Improves collaboration

A daily stand-up is a great way to assess how members of your team could be working together on present or future projects. We’re all striving for excellence, and if one person’s skills could boost someone else’s work, you’ll be able to piece that partnership together from information in a standup.

## 7. Measures progress

One of the [12 principles of Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) states, “Users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely,” so measuring progress is critical. A daily report provides an honest assessment for the team. Plus, it makes it easy to track improvements or make note of where people are getting stuck.


## 8. Encourages positive team building

The more co-workers are around each other, the more comfortable they’ll be with speaking up and offering feedback. Open communication is not only a key factor in an agile office; it’s an important part of any great team.
