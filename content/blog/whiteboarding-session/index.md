With the increase in e-learning, digital classrooms, gamification, and remote work, more individuals must lead online whiteboarding meetings. But running a successful whiteboarding session can feel a bit daunting. We’ll give you our best tips for running this type of session to help you prepare.

## **What is a whiteboarding session?**

Whiteboarding is when a **group of contributors write, sketch, and brainstorm ideas on a whiteboard.** A whiteboard application allows users to collaborate remotely through technology as though they’re participating in an in-person whiteboarding session.

Online whiteboard applications make it easier to facilitate remote group activities, including:

- Video conferencing
- Document sharing and editing
- Infinite whiteboarding space
- Capturing and saving team ideas for future reference

## **How whiteboarding boosts collaboration**

A whiteboarding session boosts collaboration by bringing teams together to share ideas, ask questions, and develop solutions openly. A whiteboard allows all participants to think creatively and contribute in a no-judgment environment. 

When everyone is working around a whiteboard, whether physical or online, it **boosts morale by valuing every member’s ideas and opinions.** Whiteboards engage teams to work together to resolve problems or increase productivity. Collaboration is the most effective when every member feels supported and heard.

## **When are whiteboarding sessions most effective?**

Whiteboarding is a great way to engage teams when you need everyone’s input and is particularly effective in these scenarios:

- **Visual thinking**: [Studies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier) have found that visually capturing ideas can help individuals understand the composition and expression on a deeper level. Many enterprises use visual thinking to illustrate flowcharts and design products.
- **Collaborative learning**: Whiteboards enable collaborative learning by creating a learning environment that encourages participation, problem resolution, and experimentation.
- **Brainstorming**: A whiteboard can offer an infinite canvas for ideation. The board can easily be modified, edited, and categorized to allow free-thinking and collaboration.
- **Gathering feedback**: An online whiteboard allows teams or individuals to share concepts, documents, or products to get real-time feedback and constructive evaluation.

## **Prepare for your first whiteboarding session**

Great whiteboarding sessions require careful planning and preparation to be successful. Here are a few tips to ensure your first whiteboard session is effective.

### **Use an online collaborative whiteboard**

Even if your team isn’t remote, you should use an online collaborative whiteboard because of its robust features that [surpass a physical whiteboard’s capabilities](https://vibe.us/blog/6-reasons-why-the-standard-whiteboard-is-becoming-obsolete/). An online whiteboard hands every participant a pen and the ability to add to the whiteboard in real-time. 

You no longer need to erase or discard ideas or thoughts to make room for more information with infinite whiteboard space. You can simply create more space. 

A collaborative whiteboard engages participants and keeps them focused on the meeting’s purpose. Then the software captures and saves all whiteboard concepts into a viewable document for later reference.

### **Use a template to focus your session**

When using an online whiteboard, you can create a template that **organizes and structures the meeting to focus** on resolving an issue or working toward a common goal. Having a template saves time and helps everyone work more efficiently.

You can [create your own whiteboard template](https://vibe.us/software/) or use an existing template. You can create different templates depending on your meeting’s goal, whether it’s brainstorming, strategy planning, or product development.

### **Leverage the infinite canvas feature**

With an online whiteboard, you need to take advantage of the infinite canvas feature by uploading any relevant content to enhance and support your meeting discussion. Try to structure the space intuitively so that team members can easily access, examine and contribute to any uploaded content.

### **Focus participants during brainstorming**

To get participants to think outside the box and create new ideas that facilitate better solutions, you need to **create a no-judgment environment** where all ideas are good—even if they’re out of left field. As the session builds, take some of the best ideas and have participants expand on those concepts to keep the flow going.

**Write the main goal or problem to resolve in a central space** on the whiteboard to keep everyone’s attention on the main topic. List prompt questions to spark ideation or get things rolling in the direction you need.

Brainstorming is about **quantity instead of quality**. You can edit and evaluate after the session is over. 

### **Create a space for rogue ideas**

If ideas **start to get off-topic, create a space on the board** to capture and revisit those ideas later. Creating a “parking lot” for great ideas that aren’t necessarily on topic creates a valid space for them. And now you can refocus the group back on topic.

You can address and revisit any ideas in the parking lot at the end of the meeting to determine their value and relevance moving forward. You’ll want at least five to ten minutes to resolve these ideas and organize how you will address them in the future.

### **Encourage all participants to contribute**

In meetings, some participants are always more vocal than others. An online whiteboard encourages these quieter participants to add value in more subtle ways, such as:

- Using the chat feature
- Adding notes
- Uploading supportive content

Depending on your meeting’s structure, you can assign different participants to lead other discussion points. By empowering them to control the discussion, they can come prepared to lead and contribute.

### **Activate your video conference camera**

While not everyone enjoys being on camera, having each participant activate their camera will increase engagement. Seeing all the participants makes the session feel more personal and encourages team bonding and culture building.

Participants will also feel more inclined to activate their camera if they’re told beforehand to expect to have it on. Encourage this for all remote meetings to create a company norm, which will reduce employee pushback.

## **Make whiteboarding sessions successful with careful planning**

Before your first whiteboarding session, ensure that all participants have access to the whiteboard application, are prepared to turn on their camera, and be aware of the session’s goal. When participants have time to prepare, they will be more inclined to share ideas and collaborate with other participants.
