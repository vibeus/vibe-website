Back to school time is here — with a twist. Many of us are preparing to head back to the office, at least part-time. Even if there’s no change to your WFH schedule on the horizon, you’re probably looking for ways to spruce up your home office. 

Whether you’re shopping for yourself, your team, or your favorite student, it’s wise to shop smart and get the best deals possible. Let’s learn more about the best time to buy new laptops, monitors, office furniture, and other supplies. 

## Know what you want, then hunt for deals

Before you buy anything, know exactly what you want to purchase. If you can narrow down the type of laptop you need based on specs, you’ll have an easier time filtering out options. It’s only a great deal when the product you receive is what you had in mind (or better!). 

For that reason, we recommend starting your search for laptops and similar electronics on [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/), [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics-computers/), [Tom’s Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews), and [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/reviews/). Once you’ve scoured the review, you can feel confident in navigating deals and discounts for [home office tech](https://vibe.us/blog/how-to-clean-home-office-tech/). 

### Laptops

Let’s start with laptops: the key tool many of us rely on to make our income. Fortunately, there are a few different times of year to find good deals. First, you can find deals in the early spring (think March to April) as manufacturers are getting ready to release new models. 

Next, keep your eyes peeled during the Back to School specials. Retailers want a cut of all the money being spent on supplies for the new school year. Start searching before Amazon’s Prime Day (June 21-22 this year) and continue the hunt through early September if necessary. 

Finally, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are excellent days to search for deals on laptops. You may find good prices throughout the holiday season as well. 

### Office furniture

What about office furniture? Maybe you’re thinking about a standing desk, ergonomic chair, comfy couch, or storage pieces. You’ll find good prices after tax day (April 15). If you need a bit more time to replenish your account after paying taxes, you can also find discounts during Back to School time. (Noticing a theme here?)

Keep an eye out for discounts on floor models. These pieces are often in great condition with no flaws or a little wear and tear. If you’re interested in second-hand items, you’ll notice more items during the summer months. People move more during this season and are more likely to donate or consign them. Be sure to also stop by regularly during the beginning of the year. The “out with the old, in with the new” mindset may just work out in your favor! You can even find some [fun designs](https://vibe.us/blog/office-design-ideas/) that you may not have considered before.

### Monitors, televisions, and other electronics

Looking to add some electronics to your home or in-person office? For monitors, the best time to buy starts with clearance sales in January and February. Look out for great deals on Prime Day as well as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. 

To save on televisions, shop sales around Super Bowl Sunday and in late March or early April when many manufacturers are clearing out last year’s models. It’s also a good idea to look for discounts on Mondays when manufacturers often offer rebates.

How about digital cameras? They usually go on sale in February, and the sales start up again in the second quarter of the year (April to June). 

## Create a simple calendar for timely deals

Now how do you keep up with all of the deals so you can compare them accurately? There are several methods, and it really comes down to your preferences. For easy access on the go, try the Notes app on your smartphone. For more detailed tracking, use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to keep track of the best time to buy what you need. [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) is another visually appealing option for creating categories and collaborating with others. 

## Other ways to save on tech tools

Don’t forget you can use cashback sites like [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/), [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/page/DR-US-Simplified-Yellow-General/?utm_source=goog&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=GOOG_US_200603_Brand_All_All_Brand-Pure_RSA_DR-US-Simplified-Yellow-General&utm_content=DR-US-Simplified-Yellow-General&gclid=Cj0KCQjwk4yGBhDQARIsACGfAeuStjCpZgOmcT-Oa1-VHOGwTcXpCC-uYMekT4GXdlkQpg7zwJE-VDQaAq20EALw_wcB&from=r), and [Coupon Cabin](https://www.couponcabin.com/) to save even more on a great deal. If you’re shopping primarily on Amazon, use [The Camelizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-camelizer/ghnomdcacenbmilgjigehppbamfndblo?hl=en) Google Chrome extension for price drop alerts and price charts.   
While setting up your office is always a bit of an investment, you can experience the full benefit of team collaboration at a reasonable price. All it takes is a bit of research and discount-hunting.
