Thanks to the internet, starting your own business has become easier than ever. There are a ton of great resources that'll help you assemble your own website, and promoting your company is a breeze with social media. Whether your business consists of just you, or a small team, you'll still need to make sure that you're clear about your end goals. Where do you see your company going by the end of the year? Or, in five years?

That's where a digital whiteboard can come in handy. Even if you currently lack a physical office space, a whiteboard like the Vibe board will provide you with everything you need to stay on task. It'll also let you communicate with others from the comforts of your own home. Here's why it's an essential purchase for anyone starting out.


## You can draft out ideas on a logo or slogan. 

A good logo is everything. And while it might not be top of mind, eventually you'll want to hire a designer to create something that'll make your business stand out. "A brand logo is exclamatory," writes Alexander Westgarth from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/11/30/the-importance-of-having-the-right-logo/#1e407e0e1ccb). "It acts as a symbol of success and a commitment to the customer. It is the fulfillment of a partnership between a business owner and a graphic designer, whose collaboration is an act of communication and whose final design is the result of discussions about what the logo should do." Since you'll likely be working with a designer remotely, drawing on a digital whiteboard is a great way to get your thoughts across.


## You can conduct interviews to find fresh new talent. 

Whether you're looking for a partner or just someone to fix your website, you can use your digital whiteboard as an "office." Vibe boards connect with apps like Zoom, meaning that you can virtually meet and screen new people. If you're used to interviewing in an office set-up it may seem a little strange at first â€” but once you get used to online interviews, you might wind up preferring it. 


## You can keep your notes safe and secure. 

It's important to keep documents, especially as your business turns into something real. Digital whiteboards like the Vibe board have infinite canvases that you can save and access later. It's a much neater way of keeping things together than writing them down by hand. The Vibe board also makes even the messiest of handwriting legible, so you won't waste any time wondering what you scribbled down. 


## You can make presentations for clients.

If your business requires you to pitch to different clients, a digital whiteboard is a fantastic way to make an impression. It's also easier than ever to put a visually stunning presentation together that'll wow the crowd. It's a step above a PowerPoint, and much easier to control on your own. If you own your own board, you can even practice your presentation the day before, just to guarantee that it's flawless.


## You can chat with long-distance employees on a big screen. 

Zoom meetings are fun, but they're even more special on a Vibe board. It'll take your e-conferencing to a whole new level. Having employees work from their own space and connecting digitally will save you a ton of money. And when you're first starting out, every dollar counts. Digital whiteboards have access to apps that'll make working a lot easier. 


## You can use it to jot down costs and expenses. 

Little purchases can add up. If you want to make note of something that you can later add to a more official spreadsheet, your Vibe board is a great way to do just that. While it's ideal for big projects, it's also good if you just need to jot down a few notes at a time. 


## If you have a small team, it's great for a brainstorm. 

Maybe you have the basic ideas down, but want your team to expand on them. Whether they're in person or far away, a digital whiteboard will allow them to sketch out their plan, whether it's in the form of a drawing or a flow chart. People form ideas in different ways. Since the Vibe board is accessible to everyone, even through their computer, it's a solid method for people to create genius ideas in their own time. 


## It's also a good way to connect them to workflow apps.

Workflow apps can save your business both time and money. If your business consists of many small projects, it's imperative that your fellow employees are all organized and on the same page. Consider your digital whiteboard to be the hub to get them on track. It's also a good way to assign your employees a daily to-do list that you can easily check on.
 

## It can help you find a new office space. 

If your business is starting to expand, you can check out available rental space through your Vibe board. Since it connects to the internet, you can search for listings and find the right one to help you grow your business. You can also easily share them with the rest of your team if you're looking for their insight. If they plan on moving into the space with you, you'll want to make sure you find something convenient for all of your employees.


## It can serve as a motivational board. 

Sometimes, you can be your own worst enemy when it comes to starting something new. Even if you have a great idea for a business, it can be hard to find the motivation to make it as successful as you want. Or, perhaps you're ready to start, but know you won't be able to grow for a year or two. Set up a canvas and sketch out motivational photos and quotes that you can look at whenever you need inspiration. Images can be easily copied and pasted onto your board, so assembly is fairly simple.  Let your board remind you that you have the skill to make your idea really come to life.
