One of the most effective ways to generate new ideas is through brainstorming. Brainstorming involves generating ideas to solve problems, and the goal of a brainstorming session is for the team to produce a vast array of ideas. From there, the team can draw links between the ideas on their way to finding solutions. 

To put together an effective brainstorming session, you need the right tools, and one of the best tools to use in this situation is a whiteboard. So if you’re serious about getting the most out of your team in terms of brainstorming, it makes sense to investigate what a digital whiteboard can do for you. Read on to learn how a whiteboard can help your brainstorming session.

## What happens in a brainstorming session?

First, it’s important to understand that brainstorming sessions are different from regular meetings. Here’s what should happen during a team brainstorm:

### Share ideas without hesitation

During a brainstorming session, team members should feel free to share ideas without hesitation or fear of suggesting a “bad” idea. 

No one should be penalized for coming up with an idea that seems like it won’t work. Instead, encourage your employees to throw out as many ideas as possible to get the creative juices flowing and to hopefully find an idea that sticks. 

### Engage in creative thinking

During a brainstorming session, you should encourage your employees to think creatively. To inspire creative thinking, your team should focus on quantity over quality. 

In other words, let them come up with as many ideas as possible instead of focusing on coming up with a few really good ideas. You should also withhold criticism and welcome unusual ideas to the table. 

### Ideas are captured, developed, and shared

Even though you want to encourage free-thinking in your brainstorming sessions, there still needs to be some type of structure to it. 

To capitalize on exciting ideas, we suggest using a whiteboard. A whiteboard will ensure that everyone can see the ideas in front of them. When you write everything on a whiteboard, you’ll also have an easier time connecting the dots and developing them further. 

Plus, with a digital whiteboard, you can share the ideas after the brainstorming session so your team members can continue to think about them.

## Benefits of brainstorming with a whiteboard

Whether it’s a digital whiteboard or a standard whiteboard, having a shared creative space is helpful for brainstorming sessions. Here are just a few reasons why a whiteboard is a must-have.

### They’re a good way to organize your thoughts

When it comes to brainstorming, sometimes one idea might turn into something much stronger. By jotting things down for your team, you’ll be able to reiterate important notes. If you have a digital whiteboard, these notes can be easily saved and made accessible at any time. With a standard whiteboard, employees can take their time to jot down important bullet points in a notebook or a computer doc to reflect on later.

### They’re great for employees who learn in different ways

By using different color markers and occasionally drawing out an idea instead of using text, you’re making it easier for all members of your brainstorm to follow along. If you have anyone on your team who may be a little rusty with your language (either the language you speak or the language and lingo of the office and your field) using a whiteboard will help them digest information better. When everyone on your team understands your main goal, you’re destined to have a successful brainstorm.

### They’re easy to assemble

Once it’s in your office space, you’re good to go. While PowerPoints are a great way to get information across, jotting down thoughts and goals on a whiteboard is a lot easier and will save a ton of time. Plus, you won’t have to deal with missed slides. For virtual whiteboards, everyone on your team will be able to access your notes later.

### Digital whiteboards allow you to connect to other programs

If you are in a meeting with potential clients, a digital whiteboard will truly impress them. And as for the team in your office, digital whiteboards are a great way to connect while brainstorming together. If your boss is in another country during a team meeting, they can easily [connect to your whiteboard using Zoom](https://vibe.us/android-app-store/) and participate virtually. They will also have access to the canvases and notes that the team put together in their absence—no fax machine or email attachments necessary.

### Your presentation will be more engaging

Have you ever sat down and thought about how much text you take in per day? Whether it’s on screens, in printed literature, or through text message. Whiteboards offer a nice break from that. Not only can you use colors, but you can also draw images.

Scientists are still studying how the human brain processes art, but it’s an interesting concept. When people see an image of something as opposed to text, part of their brain actually feels the need to mimic the act. [The Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-does-the-brain-process-art-80541420/) reported on this phenomenon back in 2012.

“Viewers of Degas’ ballerinas sometimes report that they experience the sensation of dancing—the brain mirrors actions depicted on the canvas,” wrote Abigail Tucker. While you may not be an artist yourself, there’s a benefit to mixing things up when it comes to brainstorming.

### Increase employee engagement and productivity

Another great thing about whiteboards is that they foster participation and engagement. By having an engaging visual set up in front of your team, employees will feel more motivated to participate during brainstorming sessions. 

In busy brainstorming sessions and meetings, employees can feel left out and like their ideas don’t matter. With a whiteboard set up in front of the group, people are more likely to feel they have a say. And, if you remind your team members that there’s no such thing as a bad idea when brainstorming, they’ll feel more motivated to participate. If any employee doesn’t feel motivated to work, they’re more likely to spend time sitting at their desk surfing the web (or worse, looking for another job). But when they feel the motivation to improve the company, they’ll be more likely to get things done. 

In other words, higher motivation levels lead to higher productivity levels.

### Go high tech in meetings without stressing the IT department

Bringing technology into a brainstorming session can be tough if you’re not technologically savvy. Oftentimes, when companies try to bring more technology into meetings, they have to involve the IT department. 

Doing so will pull your IT department away from other important tasks. If you’re looking for a way to bring technology into brainstorming sessions without burdening the IT department, digital whiteboards are the answer. 

The best digital whiteboards are intuitive to use and easy to set up. The learning curve is very small, as you pretty much just need to plug the whiteboard into the wall and start playing. In this scenario, your IT department doesn’t have to get involved every time you want to run a brainstorming session.

## Industries where whiteboards work best

So, what industries should be using digital whiteboards for their brainstorming sessions? While many industries can benefit from digital whiteboards, here are the industries that can benefit the most: 

### Education

With technology becoming more integrated into classrooms each day, it’s no wonder that digital whiteboards are beneficial for the education industry. Gone are the days where teachers write everything on black chalkboards or plain whiteboards. 

With interactive digital whiteboards, teachers can make learning come to life for their students. Digital whiteboards are also beneficial for other educational environments beyond the traditional classroom. For example, educators can use them in workforce training, onboarding, and distance learning situations.

### Tourism and hospitality

The tourism and hospitality industry can also benefit from digital whiteboards. Just as one example: if you’re creating a sales presentation for a timeshare, a digital whiteboard offers a visually interesting way to make your pitch. 

The large canvas and drawing space that a digital whiteboard offers can be extremely useful when reconfiguring restaurant layouts, deciding on a floor layout for a big event, or brainstorming ways to book more trips through your travel agency. 

### Healthcare

Healthcare and technology are becoming more integrated by the day. A digital whiteboard can help healthcare facilities with a wide variety of daily tasks, from mapping patient charts to creating diagnostics to sharing information between providers. 

Hospitals can be very busy places, so you can also use digital whiteboards to help you create schedules and organize the flow of healthcare workers. 

### Corporate business

It’s not hard to imagine the ways in which digital whiteboards can help corporations. Many corporations run weekly presentations, and digital whiteboards can help your organization present information to clients in an engaging and easy manner. 

People can also use digital whiteboards for digital meetings and cross-collaboration among teams. You can also use them to collaborate with outsourced service providers. 

### Finance

Finally, digital whiteboards are a huge benefit to the financial industry. Companies can use them to promote products to consumers, such as credit cards or portfolio options. You can also use them when presenting to investors.
