Whiteboards are, without a doubt, a great way to communicate with other people. In college, the whiteboard was the perfect addition to your dorm door. It inspired friends to draw pictures, and leave kind notes behind. Back then, it was a convenient way to see who stopped by.
 
In the office, it's a great tool for brainstorming. Since many people are visual learners, it's a great way to make sure points get across and help illustrate the task at hand. However, these days, the standard whiteboard is becoming somewhat obsolete.
 
And, that's because technology has taken over. The way we communicate today is much different than how it was 20 years ago. Back then, nobody had cell phones. Letter writing was more popular. And, social media wasn't around. Digital whiteboards are the way of the future, and the best way to make sure everyone's on the same page. Here's why.
 

## 1. Not many people are in the office anymore. 

The pandemic changed the way that we do work. Jobs that require a computer can mostly be done from the comforts of home. Meanwhile, that standard whiteboard is becoming useless. With a digital whiteboard, you can conduct virtual meetings and also have an endless amount of canvas to jot down ideas with coworkers all over the world. Even if offices open back up to the level everyone's used to, a digital whiteboard is a great tool to have.
 

## 2. Those with poor handwriting don't need to worry about clarity. 

Not all of us have fine penmanship. Digital boards like Vibe can easily turn handwriting into something more legible that everyone will be able to read. Even better, those who might have trouble seeing a standard whiteboard from a distance can access a digital whiteboard online, making it much more useful.
 

## 3. A digital whiteboard eliminates note-taking.

It's good practice to jot down notes at a meeting. That way, you have a good reminder as to what went down and what was discussed. With a digital whiteboard, all of the information presented is saved, so that you can access it later without missing a moment of the meeting when it's happening in real-time. A standard whiteboard doesn't have this function. Even worse, sometimes notes made on a whiteboard are erased before you've had time to jot down what was written.
 

## 4. Standard whiteboards aren't helpful for employees who are living or working overseas.

It's 2020, which means that your employees might live all around the globe. It's normal for a company to have multiple offices in different countries. If a meeting takes place that uses a standard whiteboard, plenty of staff members won't have access to what was said. Keeping record of meetings is beneficial for employees, especially new hires who are trying to learn more about the business.
 

## 5. Standard whiteboards require materials to use them. 

How many times have you actually grabbed a Sharpie instead of a dry erase marker? That's one thing you don't need to worry about when using a digital whiteboard. Once you buy a digital, all the tools you need are already included. Gone will be the days of grabbing a marker that's on its last legs, or a color that's a lot lighter than you anticipated. Plus, you don't have to worry about cleaning off your board for use later. Everything's saved and secure.
 

## 6. Standard whiteboards aren't accessible everywhere.

It's in the room with you, and that's as good as it gets. But digital whiteboards can easily be checked on your phone or laptop. That means that you're virtually carrying your work notes with you wherever you go. It couldn't be more convenient.
 
While there will always be a place in everyone's hearts for a standard whiteboard, having a digital whiteboard is much more convenient for people's lifestyles today. By investing in one, you're investing in a better way to connect with your team.
