[InfoComm](https://www.infocommshow.org/) is the largest audio-visual and integrated experience event in North America. Each year, more than 1,000 exhibitors congregate at InfoComm to showcase thousands of new products for nearly 44,000 attendees from 110 countries. This year’s event is being held from June 8th to the 14th in sunny Orlando, FL.

Is Vibe going to be there? Oh, you know we will. Charles Yang and Susie Deng from the Vibe team will be on the exhibition floor showing everyone what the [Vibe digital whiteboard](https://vibe.us/product/) is all about.

What are we most excited about?


# What we’re looking forward to the most at InfoComm 2019

There’s always a new event to explore or opportunity to learn something at InfoComm. Here are some exciting new things that caught our eye:

Kicking off, there’s a new location for the opening reception — [Pointe Orlando](http://www.pointeorlando.com/). This complex is home to a number of events spaces, dining experiences and more. We’re ready for some fun!

In addition, InfoComm 2019 will feature free education sessions at the Center Stage, a hub for creative dialogues that will serve as a platform for leading thinkers and practitioners in several industries. These sessions are always free — no sign-up necessary — and hosted right in the heart of the conference.

This marks Vibe’s first appearance at the event as well. [Come visit us at Booth 3786](https://infocomm19.mapyourshow.com/7_0/exhibitor/exhibitor-details.cfm?ExhID=770239) on west level 2 in the Exhibit Hall.

# Saying hi to everyone

Without a doubt, our favorite part of InfoComm is meeting with fellow attendees and exhibitors. At this year’s event, the [Orange County Convention Center](https://www.occc.net/) will partner with [Hyatt Regency Orlando](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/florida/hyatt-regency-orlando/mcoro) to offer a series of industry-specific networking events for leaders in tech, retail, live events, and hospitality. There will also be a networking event designed to promote diversity.

In addition, there will be a Women’s Council breakfast on Thursday morning that regularly sells out (don’t worry gents, you’re encouraged to join as well). Add your registration early to [secure a spot](https://www.compusystems.com/servlet/EventExplorerServlet?ACTION=LOAD_SA_EVT_EXP&EVT_UID=208&EVT_EXP_IDENT=81ds7&SEARCH_FIELD_opd_id=WTB&SEARCH_KEYWORD=keyword%20search).


# Orlando, an amazing destination

Millions flock to Orlando every year for a reason. Orlando is one of the country’s great tourist destinations, from [Disneyworld](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/) to its off-the-beaten-path [restaurant scene](https://www.zagat.com/l/top-food-in-orlando) (who wants to try some gator?) We might even take a little break from the excitement of InfoComm to [commune with some manatees](https://www.getyourguide.com/orlando-l191/orlando-manatee-encounter-t51118/) out on the open water.
