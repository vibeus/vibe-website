Work from home is here to stay, and although it brings with it many benefits, it also comes with a unique set of challenges. From maintaining productivity to boosting morale, it’s more important than ever to know how to manage a team and promote remote employee engagement.

According to a [productivity study from Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1140732/work-from-home-productivity-employees-us/), 44.9% of workers felt more productive at home, 34.5% felt less productive, and 20.6% felt no change as of June 2020. Additionally, [Blog Otter](https://blog.otter.ai/work-from-home-statistics/) found that 47% of workers struggle to work from home due to distractions, 20% find it challenging to collaborate and communicate with their team, and 35% feel isolated and disconnected.

With all these challenges in mind, you can find solutions to address those feelings of disconnection and lack of productivity. Here are 10 effective tools for managing a remote team.

## Basecamp

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) is an all-encompassing project management software for managing remote employees. This tool allows you to divide work into projects that contain documents and files related to it. You then add whichever teammates are working on the project to see relevant files, conversations, tasks, deadlines, and more.

This is ideal for keeping your team on track and productive. It’s easy to let deadlines fall by the wayside when working remotely; this organizational tool can help.

## Tips for managing remote teams

Now you know what software you need for managing remote employees, but what are some general tips for increasing productivity and collaboration? Consider these:

- **Team building.** With everyone spread out, make sure to schedule regular socials and online events to bring your team together. This helps combat isolation and creates a sense of community.
- **Breaks.** Encourage your team to take frequent breaks and stop working at a reasonable hour. With their desk right by their bedroom, it’s tempting for employees to work extra long hours. This induces burnout and harms overall productivity.
- **Distractions.** Teach your team how to combat at-home distractions, such as pets, kids, or neighbors. Tips include investing in daycare or signaling when you’re working, such as closing the door or putting on headphones.
- **Collaboration.** Encourage your team to schedule regular meetings with each other to discuss new ideas and work together. Working in separate locations (and perhaps across different time zones) makes the ability to bounce ideas around more limited, but being intentional about it helps.

Collaborating is more crucial than ever for innovation and creativity. It’s essential for team leaders to recognize what their team needs and provide the best tools to promote team collaboration.
