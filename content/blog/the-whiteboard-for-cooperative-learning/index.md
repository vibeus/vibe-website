In education, learning and working together is becoming more important than ever. At Vibe, learning and teamwork are at the core of everything we do. We believe that cooperative learning and collaborative working lead to successes and discoveries that one person alone could never have imagined.

As a company that looks to the future, cooperative learning has always been a source of fascination and inspiration to the Vibe team. Traditional education, limited by the tech of the distant past, has never truly accommodated the range of ways in which young people learn, or even taken full advantage of some of the most widely effective and proven techniques. 

The Vibe interactive whiteboard aims to modernize education and give teachers the tools they need to nurture a generation of bright, informed, innovative thinkers who excel at working together.


## Interactive Whiteboard in the Classroom

[According to the Yale School of Education](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/ActiveLearning), active learning is defined as “anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing.” This type of learning prepares students to apply their knowledge in real-world situations, by engaging their brains in mindful actions rather than passive observation or memorization.

Vibe’s interactive whiteboard brings active learning to life in the classroom for both teachers and students. According to Yale, [teachers who use a variety of visual tools and technologies typically have more active and engaged classes](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/WhiteboardsChalkboards). Even the combination of a low-tech whiteboard and a PowerPoint projector is more effective than one of these alone, but the interactive whiteboard goes beyond just displaying lecture notes, offering endless possibilities for in-class projects and activities.

Simple tools are available on the interactive whiteboard, like screen capture and sharing, which also make it easier to recap each class and share lecture notes quickly, leaving more class time open for more engaging activities.

Interactive whiteboards give teachers and students the capability to create full concept maps as a group. These spatial charts of information are especially helpful for more visual learners, as noted by [the University of North Carolina School of Education](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/using-concept-maps/), and can be used in lots of contexts, from review sessions to creative brainstorming.

Vibe’s interactive whiteboard has an infinite canvas, enabling teachers and students to create concept maps of any shape or size, which can then be saved, shared, and referred to again and again. Vibe's software can also be used on different devices - so for group projects, students can continue working on a Vibe board from a computer browser or iPad, allowing for collaborating and brainstorming in real time even from different locations.

Being able to do this together, whether to make a quick point, or to flesh out an idea too big to fit within a Google document, brings cooperative learning to a whole new level that can easily translate to better workplace collaboration as well.

## Advantages to Collaborative Learning

As [Dr. Debra Mashek of Harvey Mudd College](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/relationships-intimate-and-more/201602/collaboration-its-not-what-you-think) puts it, “Cooperating additionally involves information and resource sharing (e.g., human, financial, space, technology) for mutual benefit and to achieve a common purpose. More formal than Coordinating, Cooperating requires increased organizational commitment and alteration of individual activities.” 

Whether in the workplace or the classroom, true success depends on the quality of teamwork. Vibe aims to help teachers, tutors, and students to harness the untapped power of seamless collaboration.
