In education, learning through collaboration is more important than ever. Cooperative learning and collaborative work lead to the kinds of success and discovery that one person alone could never imagine. Learning and teamwork are at the core of everything we do at Vibe.

As a company that looks to the future, cooperative learning is a source of fascination and inspiration for our team. Traditional education, limited by the tech of the past, no longer truly accommodates the range of ways in which young people learn. And even some of the new classroom technology still doesn’t utilize the most widely effective and proven techniques.

The Vibe interactive whiteboard aims to modernize education and give teachers the tools they need to nurture a generation of bright, informed, innovative thinkers who excel at working together.

## Promoting student engagement in the classroom

[According to the Yale School of Education](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/ActiveLearning), active learning is defined as “anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing.” This type of learning prepares students to apply their knowledge in real-world situations by engaging their brains in mindful actions rather than passive observation or memorization.

Vibe’s interactive whiteboard brings active learning to life in the classroom. According to Yale, [teachers who use a variety of visual tools and technologies typically have more active and engaged classes](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/WhiteboardsChalkboards). Even the combination of a traditional whiteboard and a PowerPoint projector is more effective than one of these alone. But the interactive whiteboard goes beyond simply displaying lecture notes. Instead, it offers endless possibilities for in-class projects and activities.

## Using interactive whiteboards for classroom collaboration

It’s important to note that “interactive” doesn’t have to mean “complicated.” Simple tools are available on interactive whiteboards, like screen capture and sharing. These features make it easier to recap each class and share lecture notes quickly, leaving more class time for more engaging activities.

Interactive whiteboards also allow teachers and students to create full concept maps as a group. These spatial charts of information are especially helpful for more visual learners, as noted by [the University of North Carolina School of Education.](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/using-concept-maps/) Plus, they can be used in many contexts, from review sessions to creative brainstorms.

With its infinite canvas, the Vibe digital whiteboard enables teachers and students to create concept maps of any shape or size. These projects can be saved, shared, and referred to again and again. Vibe’s software can also be used on different devices. Students can continue working on a board from their own computer or iPad, allowing groups to collaborate and brainstorm in real time, even from different locations.

Working together in this way takes cooperative learning to a new level. Plus, this kind of group work can easily translate to better workplace collaboration as well.

## Advantages of collaborative learning

As [Dr. Debra Mashek of Harvey Mudd College](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/relationships-intimate-and-more/201602/collaboration-its-not-what-you-think) puts it, “Cooperating additionally involves information and resource sharing (e.g., human, financial, space, technology) for mutual benefit and to achieve a common purpose. More formal than Coordinating, Cooperating requires increased organizational commitment and alteration of individual activities.”

Whether in the workplace or the classroom, true success depends on the quality of teamwork. Vibe aims to help teachers, tutors, and students to harness the untapped power of seamless collaboration.
