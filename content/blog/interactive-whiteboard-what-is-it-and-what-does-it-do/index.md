[Interactive whiteboards](https://vibe.us/hardware/) are becoming more common as a **tool for education in the classroom and the workplace**. With the ability to use a display as a **touchscreen device**, an interactive whiteboard allows you to accomplish a wide range of tasks. By using this tool, multiple people can engage in a collaborative experience through a touchscreen and take notes, annotate content, and share screens.

## How is an interactive whiteboard useful?

Many interactive whiteboards have on-board programs to assist in sharing and collaboration. Before, coworkers would physically write notes on analog whiteboards, and then would have to take photos of the board or slap “Do Not Touch” signs on it to save their work. **Interactive whiteboards remove that time and effort by taking the analog notes of the past and bringing them into the digital era.** By writing down notes on the touchscreen surface, you can share, archive, and save your notes as digital content.

**Vibe’s** [interactive whiteboard solutions](https://vibe.us/software/) **allows for integration between mobile devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones.** You can connect devices to the Vibe board either wirelessly or using an HDMI cable. From there, users can easily annotate on top of the content pulled from the connected device. You can also use it the other way around: share your Vibe project from the board for instant real-time co-creating from another Vibe board, computer web browser, or tablet.

Directly sharing content from devices makes presentations more fluid and cuts down on time spent organizing notes. And after you’re done, **there’s no need for physical storage space.** The annotated content is saved on the Vibe cloud to use later on your choice of connected device.

## Implementing interactive whiteboards in the classroom

Learning is becoming **more and more digitized**, particularly [during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/). Luckily, technology is also becoming more intuitive and takes less time to implement. Yet despite these digital improvements, many classrooms still use projector-based whiteboards.

Projector-based interactive whiteboards require more time to install and warmup. The calibration process can be more complicated than simply mounting a display. Plus, the integrator will have to make sure that the image fits and the touch capabilities function like they should. Even with professional help, these solutions need a day or so to be installed.

**Moreover, projector-based solutions can be more expensive to maintain long-term.** Bulbs need to be changed regularly; filters need to be replaced or cleaned. Comparatively, display solutions like digital whiteboards eliminate the costs of overhead plastics and filters. Maintenance is solely on an as-needed basis.

The [interactive whiteboard technology Vibe offers](https://vibe.us/android-app-store/) can **quickly and easily be installed and implemented in your classroom or boardroom in a short time**. There’s no projector, so installing this fully integrated interactive display takes less than an hour. Vibe solutions are **standalone systems that don’t need any significant wiring or programming.** In other words, you can start using it right away.

### Things to consider when installing an interactive whiteboard

When installing an interactive whiteboard, make sure that the board’s wall is **mounted with sufficient room.** Proper structural support in the wall and appropriate mounting techniques are crucial, especially for larger displays.

It’s also essential to choose an optimal location for easy viewing. **Pick a place in your classroom or boardroom that most participants will be able to see easily.**

Vibe’s interactive solutions are intuitive, user-friendly, and low-maintenance. Still, consider [follow-up training](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/news/7-stats-that-prove-training-value) for less tech-savvy employees or new employees who come into the organization for **seamless integration.**

## Benefits of using an interactive whiteboard in the classroom

Capturing the attention of an entire class is difficult in today’s fast-paced, tech-driven world. Keeping their attention and using technology to your advantage can be even more difficult. Similar to how the best teachers can integrate life, art, and science, the [best technology](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2018/02/09/using-data-and-technology-to-enhance-classroom-teaching/) combines experience, design, and science to solve your problems efficiently. Many educators have integrated technology into the classroom with [fantastic results](https://vibe.us/customer/).

Interactive technology [raises student engagement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-020-10107-5). More engaged students are more attentive, leading to a whole host of benefits: comprehension rises, test scores improve, and literacy goes up. The same engagement/attentiveness relationship holds true for corporate training and learning in adults, making the Vibe board a useful learning tool in any collaborative learning situation.

### Ways interactive whiteboards can assist with lesson plans

**Interactive learning.** Interactive whiteboards are excellent for kids to interact with the material they’re learning. Children are often tactile learners, so their understanding of the material comes from touching, drawing, or writing on the board. Entire classrooms can join in on educational games, even if you have students who are learning remotely. Since [interactive whiteboards](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-remote/) offer immediate feedback, teachers can easily assess student progress.

**Enhanced lessons.** Interactive whiteboards are useful for integrating several [learning styles](https://www.time4learning.com/learning-styles/). Students can experience an extra layer of connection to learning by hearing, seeing, and interacting with the board through touch. Because of this, students learn better and remember more.

### Making learning accessible and flexible

**Easy to use.** One of the biggest perks of interactive whiteboards? They don’t require a lot of maintenance. No messy chalk prints or marker stains! You can easily mark data by using a stylus for highlighting, drawing, and writing. There’s no need for extra writing tools or ink, which means no mess and no clean up.

**Flexibility in the classroom.** An interactive whiteboard can host a diverse range of media types. Teachers can choose from a wide array: photos, graphs, maps, illustrations, videos, and more. Vibe’s easy-to-use digital toolbox supports teachers as they create inspiring lessons plans for their students.

### Teaching through technology

**Connected to the internet.** Vibe boards are directly linked to the internet, giving you access to all of the tools and information you can find online. [Teachers](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-distance-learning/) can access many resources to support and enhance their lessons through articles, images, videos, learning tools, and more. Access to online resources also gives students a rich resource for learning and research.

**Integrated technology.** Vibe board technology lets you integrate many other technologies to help your students learn to their fullest potential. From computers to microscopes to cameras, you can attach nearly any device you can think of to the board’s HDMI-IN to further enhance instruction.
