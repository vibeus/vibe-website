## How is an interactive whiteboard useful? 

[Interactive whiteboards](https://vibe.us/hardware/) have become more common as a **tool for education in the classroom and the workplace**. With the ability to use a display as a **touchscreen device**, an interactive whiteboard allows you to accomplish a wide range of tasks, from whiteboard to [collaboration](https://www.eztalks.com/whiteboard/benefits-of-interactive-whiteboards-in-the-classroom.html). Using this tool, multiple people can engage in a collaborative experience through a touchscreen and take notes, annotate content, and share screens.

Many interactive whiteboards have on-board programs to **assist in sharing and collaboration.** Interactive whiteboards can help with education in ways that an analog whiteboard can't do. Before, employees needed to physically write notes on analog whiteboards and would have to take photos of the board or slap "Do Not Touch" signs on it to save their work. **Interactive whiteboards take away that time and effort: they automatically bring the analog notes you used to use and bring them into the digital era.** By writing down notes on the touchscreen surface, you can share, archive, and save your notes as digital content.

**Vibe's** [**interactive whiteboard solutions**](https://vibe.us/software/) **allow for mobile devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones to be integrated.** You can connect your devices to the Vibe board either wirelessly or using an HDMI cable, and easily annotate on top of the content pulled from the connected device. You can also use it the other way around; share your Vibe project from the board for instant real-time co-creating from another Vibe board, computer web browser, or tablet, taking your collaboration to the next level.

Directly sharing content from devices gives meetings more fluidly, and cuts downtime in the classroom spent organizing notes. After you're done, **there's no physical storage space needed;** the annotated content is saved on Vibe cloud to use later on your Vibe board, in browser on your PC, or by using Vibe’s mobile app on your tablet.


## Implementing interactive whiteboards in the classroom 

Learning is becoming **more and more digitized**, particularly [during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/). Luckily, technology is also becoming more comfortable to use and takes less time to implement. 

The [interactive whiteboard technology Vibe offers](https://vibe.us/android-app-store/) can **easily be installed and implemented into your school classroom, home classroom, or boardroom in a short time**. Since there isn't a projector, installing a fully integrated interactive display takes less than an hour. Configuration is straightforward, so the school or organization can have their new display ready for use the same day they installed. Since Vibe solutions are **stand-alone systems that don't need any significant wiring or programming**, you can start using it right away.

Old-school projector-based interactive whiteboards may need more time. The calibration process can be a lot more complicated than mounting a display. The integrator will have to make sure that the image fits and that the touch capabilities function like they should. Even with professional help, these solutions need a day or so to be installed.

**Moreover, projector-based solutions can be more expensive to maintain long-term,** as they need to have their bulbs regularly changed and filters replaced or cleaned. Display solutions eliminate the costs of overhead plastics and filters. Maintenance is solely on an as-needed basis.

When installing an interactive whiteboard, you need to make sure that the solution's wall is **mounted with sufficient room.** Proper structural support in the wall and appropriate mounting techniques, especially for more massive displays, are crucial. It's essential to choose an optimal location for easy viewing. **Pick a place in your classroom or boardroom that most participants will be able to see easily.**

Our interactive solutions are incredibly intuitive, user-friendly, and low-maintenance. Consider [follow-up training](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/news/7-stats-that-prove-training-value) for less tech-savvy employees or new employees who come into the organization for **seamless integration.**

## Benefits of using an interactive whiteboard in the classroom

Capturing children's hearts and the attention of adults is a difficult task in today's fast-paced, tech-driven world. Keeping their attention and being able to use technology to your advantage is an even more difficult challenge. Like how the best teachers can integrate life, art, and science, the [best technology](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2018/02/09/using-data-and-technology-to-enhance-classroom-teaching/) combines experience, design, and science to solve your problems efficiently. Many educators have integrated technology into the classroom with [fantastic results](https://vibe.us/customer/). 

**Here are some ways interactive whiteboards can assist your classroom learning.**

**Interactive learning.**
Interactive whiteboards are an excellent way for kids to interact with the material they're learning.(By interacting with the lesson material, they can even teach each other!) Children are often tactile learners, so their understanding of the material comes from touching, drawing, or writing on the board. Entire classrooms can join in on educational games, even if you're distance learning during the pandemic. Since [interactive whiteboards](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-remote/) offer immediate feedback, students and teachers can easily assess student progress.

**Enhanced lessons.**
Interactive whiteboards are a useful tool for integrating several [learning styles](https://www.time4learning.com/learning-styles/). Students can experience an extra layer of connection to learning by hearing, seeing, and interacting with the board through touch. Because of this, students learn better and remember more. 

**Easy to use****.** ****
One of the biggest perks of interactive whiteboards is that they don’t require a lot of maintenance. No messy chalk prints or marker stains! Data is easily marked using a stylus for highlighting, drawing, and writing. There is no need for extra writing tools or ink, which means no mess and no clean up.

**Flexibility in the classroom****.**
An interactive whiteboard can host a diverse range of media types. Teachers have a wide array of options to choose from: photos, graphs, maps, illustrations, videos, and more. Our easy-to-use digital toolbox supports teachers as they create inspiring lessons plans for their students.

**Connected to the internet****.** ****
Vibe boards are directly linked to the internet, giving you access to all of the tools and information you can find online. [Teachers](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-distance-learning/) can access many resources to support and enhance their lessons through articles, images, videos, learning tools, and more. Access to online resources also gives students a rich resource for learning and research.

**Integrated technology****.**
Vibe board technology lets you integrate many other technologies to help your students learn to their fullest potential. From computers to microscopes to cameras, you can attach nearly any device you can think of to the board’s HDMI-IN to further enhance instruction.

**Proven effectiveness****.** ****
Interactive technology [raises student engagement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-020-10107-5). More engaged students are more attentive, and this leads to a whole host of benefits: comprehension rises, test scores improve, and literacy goes up. The same engagement/attentiveness relationship holds true for corporate training and learning in adults, making the Vibe board a useful learning tool in any collaborative learning situation.
