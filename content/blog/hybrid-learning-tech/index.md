Hybrid learning classrooms are [becoming a valuable strategy](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1220607/covid-19-share-k-12-schools-hybrid-teaching-us/) for both teachers and students worldwide. However, one of the biggest concerns is the accessibility of technology. Luckily, with the right resources, any classroom can turn into a hybrid learning space.

Because technology is a requirement for hybrid learning, knowing which technologies are required and which ones you can do without is the first step to implementing a successful hybrid learning plan. In this guide, we’ll cover must-haves and supplemental items to help you select the right combination for your space.

## Required technology for a hybrid learning classroom

These required technologies for a hybrid learning classroom are the basic necessities that the students, classroom, or both need to have for a successful teaching and learning experience.

### Computers

**A laptop or desktop computer is essential for a hybrid learning classroom.** Their uses in the classroom include writing, note-taking, and performing independent research. While desktops are preferred, laptops do come with at least one distinct advantage: they usually have built-in microphones, speakers, and webcams, meaning that you don’t have to worry as much about accessories.

### High-speed WiFi and internet bandwidth

When implementing a hybrid learning model in the classroom, having a high-speed WiFi connection is a must to ensure that no one gets left behind. Internet bandwidth, which determines how fast data is transferred between you and your students, should be high enough not to slow down anyone’s learning—the higher, the better.

### Video collaboration technology

Video collaboration technology is a core piece for hybrid learning strategies that focus on student-centered learning. Students who can’t see each other will have a difficult time engaging and interacting. The [video collaboration hardware](https://vibe.us/lp/scenario-remote/) and software that you choose should offer more than simply recording video. It should **encourage active, synchronous collaboration.**

### Cameras

Webcams often come standard with laptops. But if you’re using desktop PCs in your classroom,setting up cameras for your students is essential for collaboration and active learning. For the teachers, [a high-quality webcam is important](https://knowledge.vibe.us/vibe-camera) so that the remote students can clearly see what’s happening in the classroom.

### Microphones

Microphones are another important component of a hybrid learning approach. While many technologies have built-in microphones, they might not be of high enough quality for classroom use. External microphones function more efficiently by blocking out the noises you don’t want them to pick up.

### Collaboration software

The right technology for your collaborative efforts is something that every hybrid learning classroom needs. This technology could be free resources like Google Classroom or customized video collaboration software purchased by your school. Interactive whiteboards, like [Vibe](https://vibe.us/), often come complete with pre-installed collaboration software to use in your classroom.

### In-class displays

In-class displays are a must-have in the physical classroom. There are various displays to consider, including:

- **Interactive whiteboards** are large displays that offer the same functionalities as a regular whiteboard, but they also encourage collaboration between teachers and students with their interactive screens and built-in software. Having an interactive whiteboard in the classroom helps students brainstorm and share notes with each other when they are distanced.
- **Projectors** are a staple of classrooms, new and old. While outclassed by newer technology like interactive whiteboards, projectors offer a budget-friendly option to display at-home students in the classroom.
- **Wireless presentation displays** are similar to interactive whiteboards, but they don’t have touch capabilities. These displays work well for presenting lecture-style lessons that don’t benefit from interactivity on a large screen for students in the classroom and at home to clearly see.

## Supplementary tech for hybrid learning classrooms

While not a requirement, this selection of supplementary hybrid learning technology can increase the comfort and productivity of your students.

### Computer accessories

There are various [computer accessories](https://vibe.us/blog/top-office-monitors-of-2021/) to enhance teacher efficiency and student participation, including the following:

- **External mouses** are not only more comfortable to use than laptop trackpads, but Bluetooth-enabled ones can be great for teachers who like to walk around the classroom while they speak. They can quickly direct students’ attention to a specific point on the screen from anywhere in the room.
- **Headphones** are a great accessory for students who get easily distracted by outside sounds. They help keep their attention and ensure that they don’t miss any part of the lesson.
- **Audio fencing technology** in the classroom helps filter out unwanted noise and distractions so that students and teachers alike can focus on the lesson at hand.

### Touch monitors

Touch monitors are great for encouraging interactivity in a hybrid learning classroom. And in some cases, touch-enabled monitors have better ergonomics so that you students stay healthy and productive. You can even add external touch monitors to many interactive whiteboards.

### Tablets

Tablets may be more limited than a computer, but they are still highly functional and extremely portable. While you shouldn’t necessarily rely on tablets as a primary teaching source in the classroom, they are a great option for note-taking, reading, and other non-intensive activities.

### Smartphones

Smartphones don’t have to be a distraction in the classroom. They are a great way to encourage your students to keep learning outside of school with educational apps and games. Many teachers choose to assign self-study programs rather than additional homework.

### Cart-based technology

Cart-based technology is an efficient and cost-effective option for schools that can’t provide microphones and cameras to each classroom. It allows teachers to move those accessories around to different areas easily using an AV cart.

### Learning management systems

Using a learning management system (LMS) offers numerous advantages in hybrid learning classrooms. They can:

- help hand out and track remote learning objectives
- offer additional e-learning tools
- store, track, and distribute information across all teachers and students

There is a variety of learning management systems to choose from, all offering various levels of collaboration and interactivity. Make sure that your school’s preferred LMS is compatible with any new hardware or accessories you choose for your classroom.

## Invest in tech to design your hybrid learning environment

Ultimately, the technologies used in your hybrid learning classroom will depend on the situation of your school and students. But it’s important to secure at least the required elements so that your students have the best chance at having a hands-on, hybrid learning experience. Now that you’ve done the research, you’re prepared to create the ultimate learning space.
