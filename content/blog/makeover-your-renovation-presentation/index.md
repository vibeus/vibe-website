Farmhouse sinks. Shiplap. Waterfall edge counters. Subway tile.
 
Popular home renovation shows have expanded our knowledge of home design elements more quickly than it takes to knock out a non-load-bearing wall. All of this instantly accessible design inspiration makes it easier than ever for people to dream up their perfect home. Just picture it: a giant kitchen island with quartz counters, a multi-functional mudroom, and old-school charm with modern perks.
 
But unlike the homeowners on TV, most people don’t begin a home renovation with a full construction crew on call. Some may opt to do the work themselves. Many others, though, will work with a team of experts to make their dream home a reality.
 
It’s certainly worth it to work with professionals. [Zillow reported](https://www.zillow.com/blog/10-things-must-do-buying-a-home-224314/) that in 2017, “the typical American homeowner has 40% of their wealth tied up in their home.” And Zillow’s Consumer Housing Trends Report from 2019 showed that [55% of homeowners](https://www.zillow.com/report/2019/buying-a-home-in-america/home-buyers-key-facts-figures/) have made some kind of financial sacrifice to afford a new home. Homeowners want to work with pros they trust when they’re renovating one of the biggest investments of their lives.
 
In many cases, homeowners will need to vet at least a contractor to begin serious work. Then, depending on the scope of the project, there’s the need for an interior designer, a landscape architect, and any number of other specialized workers.
 
Contractors who can deliver on presentation will set themselves up for success—and not just in the short term. A recent [analysis from HomeAdvisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/true-cost-report/) showed that across four generations, anywhere from 23-35% of homeowners consulted a contractor they had already worked with to get an estimate on project costs. So making a good first impression can secure work now and potentially lead to a growing roster of return clients in the future.
 

## Creating the Presentation

The first step on your way to making a great presentation is to take as many measurements, photos, and notes as possible in the initial tour of the home. This is the time to ask the homeowners all the questions necessary to get a grasp on what the project will require. All of the material you gather in the walk-through will help you create the presentation that lands you the job.
 
People [process images much more quickly](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-infographic) than text, so this is definitely a time to ‘show’ instead of ‘tell.’ You’ll need to construct practical solutions, display innovative design, and demonstrate an ability to deliver. This can be achieved by presenting your layouts and floor plans in a large-scale, interactive way.
 
This type of project will have multiple parts, so it’s important to stay organized. Using a construction design app (such as [Bluebeam](https://www.bluebeam.com/)) will help with the biggest part of the project: the floor plan. This kind of tool also helps if you plan on offering more than one design option. Whether the remodel involves one or multiple rooms, a clear illustration of the work to be done is essential.
 
Providing a variety of visuals can make a big impact. A rendering of what the space could look like helps the homeowners to envision themselves in the remodel. You could also include images of flooring, paint, or other material samples in your presentation. Then go a step further and provide links to sources you plan to get materials from so that the homeowner can browse through options. A collaborative creative process shows that this is a team effort.
 

## Make It Work

Let’s say the homeowner wants to remodel their kitchen. (And there’s a good chance they will. A recent [survey by Houzz](https://blog.houzz.com/from-pricier-kitchens-to-the-connected-home-top-remodeling-trends-according-to-houzz/) shows that 28 percent of homeowners remodeled their kitchens in 2019 and spent an average of $14,000 to complete it.) There are a lot of moving parts in a kitchen renovation: construction, plumbing, gas, electrical—and that’s before you even start on the decorative features like paint, countertop materials, flooring, and hardware.
 
A collaborative online workspace is the perfect way to present ideas while keeping clients, sub-contractors, and designers up-to-date on every aspect of the project. If someone on the team can’t be on-site one day, you can upload the pictures of the team’s progress to the board. Then anyone can sketch or make notes on the pictures or ask questions about the next steps.
 
This is also a great way for everyone on the project to share design ideas and inspiration through screenshots and links. The homeowners can make notes of what they like and which features are must-haves in their newly remodeled home. (Remember the farmhouse sink from earlier? Plan on that.) And it gives the design team a space to show off their design expertise and creative know-how in creating a beautiful space.

Vibe makes it easy to integrate as many apps as you need to make your presentation feel complete. The touchscreen allows you to sketch, make notes, and move components in a way that makes sense for the project. Instead of figuring out how to get everything you need in one place, focus on a job well done instead.
 
You’re in charge of the project, and that includes making this place feel like home. It all starts with the kind of presentation that has major curb appeal.
