# What is distance learning? 

Distance learning--a form of education in which teachers and students are in different locations--has long been a popular choice for students who were unable to access learning in the classroom. In recent years, it’s been increasingly built out to enhance education for traditional students. 

Per the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372#:~:text=Total%20public%20elementary%20and%20secondary,expected%20to%20include%20(source)%3A), more than 56 million students in the US, from elementary to highschool, are expected to be enrolled in school in the fall of 2020. Nearly 20 million students are projected to be enrolled at the college or university level. 

With 2020 quarantines forcing many schools to provide significant distance between students and follow strict health and cleaning protocols, educators, parents, and students are reevaluating what learning looks like in these modern times. 

Distance learning is key to education in 2020 and will build the foundation for future programs.


# How to use the Vibe interactive whiteboard for distance learning
## Lesson Creation
{{< common/srcset "image-1.png" "Prepare interactive whiteboard lessons." >}}


Lessons on Vibe can be prepared ahead of time, used during class time, and will still remain accessible for continued learning long after a video conference or recorded session ends. Take “showing your work” to a whole new level; with Vibe’s infinite canvas there’s never a need to erase when moving on to a new question. You can create another page or just zoom out to a different part of the canvas.


## Sharing to and from Vibe 

Bring files into Vibe easily from Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive. You can access these in their native format, like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or bring them into the whiteboard as PDFs that can be annotated over again and again. Pull images into the board with a click, and resize, move, or delete them as needed.

Board invitations for collaboration can be sent via a sharable link through email, Slack, Teams, or Zoom chat, or via QR code. There’s simple click-to-send technology to send the board via email with an attached PDF. Boards can also be saved as PDFs directly to cloud drives like Google Drive, Box, and OneDrive.


## Digital whiteboarding and annotation 
{{< common/srcset "image-3.png" "" >}}


The handwritten word--be it shared on paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard--has been a popular learning tool for centuries, and with good reason. This type of communication works well for reading/writing learning styles. Vibe offers educators and students the ability to annotate over any images or PDFs with sketches, handwriting, and sticky notes, which means that visual learning can be fully incorporated as well. With multiple participants being able to write and draw together in real-time from any location, Vibe is particularly popular for synchronous lessons.


## Screen recording with audio 

Of course, there are times when it’s just not possible to have students in the same place at the same time--even when that “place” is virtual. Asynchronous lessons are best in these situations, and have the additional benefit of being on demand for students who benefit from repetition. Given that many educators are tasked with large class sizes, recorded lessons can be a way to reach students in a personal way at scale.

Lessons done with Vibe can be recorded with both visual and audio components using popular video conferencing apps like Zoom or Teams, as well as with programs like Xrecorder.

## Direct teacher-to-student communication

Many school districts have already established which video conferencing tools are best for their community. Vibe fully supports popular video conferencing apps like Zoom, Google Meet, Webex, GoToMeeting, and Skype, so you can pick the solution that already works for your team.

In many situations, video conferencing just isn’t enough for engaged learning. Face-to-face communication is helpful, but many students learn best when they’re able to see problems calculated in real-time, taking notes together directly on the lesson’s material, or by getting immediate feedback on their work.

Vibe makes it simple for teachers to combine video conferencing with whiteboard and other apps so that learning spans multiple modalities.

## Use your favorite device

BYOD (bring your own device) has been a popular practice in the corporate world for years, and its benefits are being seen increasingly in education. Vibe allows participants to collaborate interactively on projects in the Vibe Cloud from the device of their choice, from the 55” 4K screen of the Vibe board, to computer browsers on Mac or PCs, to personal iPad and Android tablets. One can even view Vibe boards from smartphones like iPhones and Android, putting lessons directly into students' hands.


# Vibe boards power distance learning

Introducing new tools takes a period of adjustment. Fortunately, whiteboards are a familiar medium that teachers, students, and parents are likely to have used in the past. Vibe takes this ease of use and modernizes the functionality by making it easy to save, share, and collaborate in real-time.

Vibe is the smart solution for engaged education.
