There are plenty of factors to account for when you’re [searching for a new laptop](https://www.small-screen.co.uk/choosing-a-laptop-with-touch-screen-vs-non-touch-screen-which-one-is-better/). Not only do you need to assess its specs and check its memory and hardware, but you also have to consider whether you need a regular non-touchscreen laptop, a fancy gaming model, or go for **newer models with touchscreens**. Today’s modern crop of touchscreen laptops has its pros and cons, just like any other laptop feature.

This article will discuss how the touchscreen feature works, its pros and cons, and some recommended models of touchscreen and non-touchscreen laptops.

## The functions of the touchscreen feature on laptops

The two widely used types of touchscreens in laptops are resistive and capacitive. 

**Resistive**
Two layers make up the **resistive touchscreen**; pressure from the user’s touch activates the [screen](https://vibe.us/blog/7-reasons-to-invest-in-dual-monitors/). The layers are imbued with electric currents- one is conductive, and one is resistive- and is kept separate. When you touch the screen, the point of contact causes a change in the electric current, which is sensed by the software and used to perform its task of closing, opening, or swiping an app. 

**Capacitive**
Capacitive [touchscreens](https://vibe.us/blog/how-do-touch-screen-devices-work/) are composed of one layer, which functions as coordinates. The **human body stores an electrical charge**, and when we touch a capacitive touchscreen display, the point of contact shifts the electrical energy flow on the screen. Capacitive touchscreens can distinguish several points of contact, unlike resistive touchscreen, and can accommodate multiple fingers, multi-touch features, and zooming in and out.

## Touchscreen pros

**Easy, fast navigation.**
The main goal of having a touchscreen on laptops is to streamline navigation. Compared to trackpads and mouse devices, users can perform tasks more manageably, and it’s simpler to **launch and shift between applications.** Moreover, you can also use the touchscreen feature to [get your work done](https://vibe.us/blog/revamp-your-remote-interview-game-with-these-tips/) if the trackpad or keyboard stops working. 

**Suitable for drawing and note-taking.**
[Graphic designers and artists](https://thewiredshopper.com/touch-screen-vs-non-touch-screen-laptops/) often prefer a touchscreen feature. There are laptop models equipped with a touchscreen display and stylus so users can efficiently generate sketches of artworks on the go at their convenience. A **touchscreen and stylus display combo** can be a highly convenient feature package for students, as it eliminates the need to have to carry around several heavy notebooks for classes. 

**Expressive, high-quality displays.**
Touchscreen laptops tend to come with **fantastic brightness and superior color vibrancy, accuracy, and reproduction** compared to non-touchscreen displays. The majority of touchscreen models feature displays with higher resolution. [Glossy touchscreen displays](https://vibe.us/blog/choose-the-right-touch-screen-display-for-you/) respond to touch better than matte ones. Many users who work with color often typically choose touchscreen models due to their fantastic color brightness and accuracy.

## Touchscreen cons

**Batteries drain quickly.**
[Touchscreen features](https://www.delcor.com/resources/blog/should-i-buy-a-touchscreen-laptop-a-convertible-laptop-or-a-microsoft-surface) mean that the computer’s hardware has another set of processing tasks to take care of thanks to the touch panel. If you’re planning on frequently using the touchscreen feature, you will need to have a spare battery.

**Touchscreens are more expensive.**
Having a touchscreen feature will **add to the price of the laptop.** Some manufacturers offer higher-resolution touchscreen displays, which elevate the cost further.

**Adds weight.**
Adding extra technology to the computer means it takes up more **bulk and space**, making the laptop heavier. Even though the difference is in grams, a small amount of weight is noticeable in laptops.

**It's hard to view in direct light.**
Laptops featuring touchscreen displays are great for dim lighting areas but **can be difficult to use under direct lighting.** The glossy finishes on touchscreen models respond faster to touch, but this kind of finish also easily attracts fingerprints, smudges, and the like. 


## Which is better?

Users of touchscreen laptops mention that **the touchscreen feature assists with productivity** since it helps them get tasks done faster. Touchscreen models are highly feasible for specific tasks, such as doing creative work from sketching to drawing and taking quick notes. The display is more easily navigated because you can directly use your fingers. Moreover, touchscreen models are aesthetically-pleasing and offer exceptional color brightness and accuracy, which is excellent for those who work with color a lot. 

As we discussed above, these models also offer certain disadvantages. They are **heavier, more expensive, and use more batteries** than regular laptops. When it comes to the touchscreen feature, you should consider your personal needs and think about how the advantages of touchscreen laptops meet those needs.
