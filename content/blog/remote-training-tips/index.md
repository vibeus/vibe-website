Remote work options are becoming more prevalent than ever, even among some of the world’s biggest companies. In fact, a survey from KPMG showed that [68% of large enterprises](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/25/business/office-space-remote-work-pandemic/index.html) are shifting to permanent remote work options and downsizing their office space. To facilitate a productive and effective remote workforce, many corporations are investing in remote training tools to help with the transition, [onboard new employees](https://vibe.us/blog/create-effective-onboarding-practices-for-your-remote-team/), and create an environment of lifelong learning.

Key to engaging remote training is leveraging [social tools and collaboration software](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy) to increase communication. We’ll list some of the best tips and tools to enable remote training and develop a productive remote workforce.

## Choose a remote training platform you can rely on

You’ll need a reliable remote meeting platform to conduct training. There are several options on the market, and you’ll want to pick a platform that fits your budget. To encourage better training, look for a [platform that has interactive elements](https://vibe.us/blog/video-conferencing-apps-with-whiteboard/) such as:

- Breakout rooms
- [Whiteboards](https://vibe.us/blog/interactive-whiteboard-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-do/)
- Chat
- Polls

## Maintain a balance of interactive and self-guided training

When determining what to cover in your remote training meeting, you first need to evaluate your training material. Some topics may be more effective as self-guided training vs. a collaborative meeting with others. Topics that might work better as self-guided training modules include policies or processes and operations.

When you want your workforce to contribute ideas and best practices on a topic, plan on hosting an interactive meeting that allows time for skills training and techniques.

## Understand your audience’s goals

Before creating your remote training schedule, you should determine the goal of the meeting. Are you conducting a required or elective training session? Is this training necessary to solve an organizational problem? Are you improving your participants’ skill set by the end of the session?  
When you clearly define the purpose and goal of the meeting, you’ll be able to articulate a schedule that produces results.

## Make good use of existing circumstances

Remote work offers a range of benefits that you can use to improve your workforce’s productivity and well-being. By providing remote training opportunities regularly, you can improve communication, education, and management skills. When training in a remote environment, you can:

- Make courses accessible across different devices for flexibility and on-demand training.
- Engage participants through forums, chat, video conferencing, and interactive whiteboards to focus and motivate collaboration.
- Provide hands-on training through interactive software that can train while they work.
- Create quizzes, questionnaires, and polls to evaluate the effectiveness of the session.
- Create a portal where participants can access all training materials and meetings.

A remote training program encourages an ongoing learning environment and helps team leaders see who is benefiting from the training.

## Engage with your trainees

To engage with your participants, create real-world scenarios where the participants can recognize how the training will help address challenging work situations. When they’re working together to resolve issues they all face daily, the lesson benefits the whole team.

Interaction can be challenging when everyone is remote, but utilizing interactive and collaborative tools like whiteboards and chats can help keep participants actively engaged in the training session.

## Gather remote employees (if possible)

In situations where remote employees live close to one another, you may want to organize an in-person meeting at a worksite, in the office, or at a shared workspace where the team can interact face-to-face. Meeting occasionally in person can help strengthen relationships, improve teamwork, and increase accountability.

## Create moments for your team to learn from each other

Encourage participants to learn from each other by creating opportunities for them to work together on use cases or scenarios that teach the training element. Use interactive software that enables breakout rooms and smaller spaces for groups to solve specific situations related to the training topic.

## Don’t forget to take breaks

Remember to schedule breaks from training. This lets your employees rest their minds and take care of other pressing tasks or personal needs. Ideally, you’ll want to offer a break every 10 minutes. There are many techniques (for example, the Pomodoro technique) that combine sessions of focused work alternated with frequent, short breaks that have been proven to increase productivity. These breaks could be:

- Personal breaks
- Discussions/ use cases
- Knowledge checks
- Snack breaks

Giving your participants a break helps them retain information and allows them to re-engage when you reset for the next topic. [Studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alankohll/2018/05/29/new-study-shows-correlation-between-employee-engagement-and-the-long-lost-lunch-break/?sh=5f0625384efc) have found that breaks improve productivity, well-being, and performance while reducing stress that can lead to job burnout.

## Track results and recommend improvements

There are several ways to track results from remote training sessions because collaboration tools can capture discussions and participation for later analysis. Creating a training portal is another great way to track who is actively developing their skillset or learning the latest policy changes or corporate processes.

Some interactive tools like digital whiteboards can also capture work done during a session and create a PDF report to share with participants after the remote training meeting. This is an excellent way to share results and remind participants of useful solutions.

## Give them something to take home

Give participants access to notes from the meeting and an opportunity to revisit the training material after the session. Remote learning can make this more accessible because the collaboration tools can track, save, and easily send materials at the end of the session.

It’s also vital to provide additional resources for participants to deepen their understanding. These resources could be:

- Training videos
- Interactive workbooks
- Online knowledge quizzes
- Other educational resources on the topic

## Remote training offers some challenges, but many benefits

As the workforce grows more remote, collaborative training will become essential. Leverage interactive tools and software to boost communication, engage participants, and effectively capture training performance, and you’re on your way to remote training success.
