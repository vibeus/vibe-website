    - title: "What features are missing from the Starter Plan comparing to your Pro Plan?"
      body: 
- Features wise, not much!  We want you to experience all the features we have to offer, not hiding any behind some pay wall
- Starter Plan has a smaller cloud storage: 100MB compares to 2000MB per account.  Still 100MB is good enough for about 100 whiteboards
- Sharing is limited.  In our Starter Plan, a shared link cannot be turned off.  This is sufficient for personal or home use.  But if you are running a business that require more security and permission control, then please choose our Pro Plan
- No team workspace, see question below in this FAQ
- No anonymous editors support in Starter Plan
- Exports will have a Vibe watermark
- Cloud drive data sync is not available in Starter Plan
