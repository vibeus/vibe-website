        Vibe’s collaboration factor has been huge. When juggling multiple clients, it’s incredibly helpful to have
        everything saved in one place so you can easily pick up where you left off.
        As a UX designer, I like how easy Vibe is to pick up a stylus and sketch on. And for big projects we can
        even have several people working on a single canvas at once - even from remote locations.
